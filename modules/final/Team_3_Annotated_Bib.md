Kennedy, Randy. “Black Artists and the March Into the Museum.” New York Times, November 28, 2015, accessed April 19, 2017.

This article highlights the recent acquisitions of works by black artists by large, well-established museums such as the National Gallery of Art, MOMA, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston as part of a larger movement in museums and academia at the end of the 20th century to move past the narrow, Eurocentric, and male version of modernism often seen on display in museums. This text is being used as evidence for recent movements to include Black artists in museums’ large collections, and highlights the difference between museums that have been “ahead of the curve” in collecting black art like the Brooklyn Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum versus other institutions that are scrambling to include Black artists in their collection today.

This report includes statistics taken from a survey meant to shed a light on the demographics of art museum staff and graphics to display data about minority representation in these same museums. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation seeks to ensure diversity in the humanities and the arts so that contributors are fairly represented and are able to succeed regardless of their demographics. This report highlights that art museums’ collections are not the only predominantly white space, but also that the staff of these museums is controlled by mostly white individuals.

This text points to the increased acquisition and exhibitions in museums in 2015 and 2016. It specifically points out several curators from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in D.C that have recently pushed institutions to acquire works by Black artists, as well as active buyers in New York and Arkansas who have actively purchased works or received donations of works by Norman Lewis, Kara Walker, and Kehinde Wiley in the past year. This text is being used to compile museums that have attempted to grow its collection of works by Black artists since 2015, mostly by those artists already well-known by art collectors and museum goers.

Kaplan, Isaac “How African-American Artists Fought to Diversify Museums.” Artsy, December 27, 2016, accessed April 19, 2017.

This interview highlights the dynamic systems at play in the curation of black art, as well the role that black people have played in achieving holistic representation for themselves in museum spaces. While interviewee Susan Cahan’s book Mounting Frustration captures these struggles in the 60s and 70s, she discusses the structural inequalities that persist within major curatorial institutions. This interview frames the temporality of our project through its description of the ongoing fight for progress, which the author describes as “hard-won and constantly susceptible to being rolled back.”

In the context of our project, this text offers insights into how museums might create more culturally grounded, representative exhibitions within a constantly shifting demographic paradigm.

“NO SUCH PLACE: Contemporary African Artists in America”. Artsy, 2017, accessed April 19, 2017. 
https://www.artsy.net/show/edward-tyler-nahem-fine-art-llc-no-such-place-contemporary-african-artists-in-america

This page showcases African contemporary artists’ work for the exhibition “NO SUCH PLACE: Contemporary African Artists in America”. The title of this exhibition emphasizes contemporary art as a White dominated space and how important it is to spotlight Black art in a space that was not made for Black artists. The importance of showcasing Black art where it is normally excluded is meant to encourage diversity and promote Black art in museums that have historically been for white artists.

Brooklyn Museum, We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women, 1965–85, New York, accessed April 20, 2017.
https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/we_wanted_a_revolution 

This page from the Brooklyn Museum’s website displays its currently showing exhibit on art by and about African-American women, titled “We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women.” It includes art by Betye Saar, Carrie Mae Weems, Lorna Simpson, and other prominent African-American female artists. This collection of displayed art not only highlights the importance of uplifting black women through art, but also demonstrates that African-American artists are just as capable of attracting viewership and funding, two essential components of “traditional” art museums.
