# Final Project: The Black Code Studies Undercommons

## What is Black Code Studies

Black Code Studies asks: How has that cold and scientific concreteness that was and is nineteenth-century race theory persisted? How do certain racial ideologies and narratives thrive—including twentieth-century narratives of blackness and whiteness as biopolitical binaries? To what extent have race codes and coding evolved? How do these changes interface with the work of race coders—digital activists, digital feminists, and digital black studies scholars—who continue to demand new pathways for safety and survival in the face of abject violence? What are the limits of 21st century digital black coding, even when rooted in resistance and affirming black life?

As a project, Black Code Studies draws attention to the permeability of the racial subject in an age of digital media and new technology. It highlights the importance of tying technology to a history of capitalist exploitation, global black insurgence, and Afrxdiasporic creative energy. Black Code Studies outlines a rich and rigorous set of priorities for the next future of black studies, highlighting prospects for the survival of black life well beyond the Internet.

The work you are doing in this class is meant to plug into the larger Black Code Studies scholarly and political project. You are helping to build the future. 

## Timeline

* February 9, 2017: Assignment Distributed
* April 13, 2017: Final Project Proposal and Annotated Bibliography Due
* April 27, 2017: Public Presentations
* May 2, 2017: Group Project Reviews / Class Reflections
* May 4, 2017: [B-Side] Class Reflections

## The Assignment

Your final assignment is to design a project of your own using the following questions as guides:

> What would an underground to the undercommons look like?
> What would a vision of blackness that is digital but without boundaries look like?
> What is Black Code Studies?
> What does Black Code Studies look, sound, smell, feel, taste like?


Each team's project is entirely up to you and your team. You may find the following examples useful:

* AAIHS
* Diaspora Hypertext, the Blog
* New Black Man in Exile
* The African Diaspora, Ph.D. Universe
* The Art and Digital Work of Pierre Bennu
* Cultural Front
* Another Round Podcast
* Black Code Studies Playlist
* Black Haunts in the Anthropocene
* Colored Conventions Project
* Any of the projects we have covered or discussed thus far

Finally - each project must also link to the other. Your ICB will play an important role in this. 

## Team Preparation

Each Team must designate one member to the following positions:
* Intergalactic Coordinator of Blackness - Inter-Team Liaison
* Professor Liaison 

Github and Slack are your basecamps. Use them to coordinate with your teams and with me.

## Annotated Bibliography 

POSTED ON GITHUB - First Draft April 20, 2017; Final Due day of Final Presentation

Compile a list of pre-digital/analog sources that exemplify/carry/represent digital resonances (or hauntings) of the digital moment.

* 5 text and 2 non-text items 
* 2-3 sentences of explanation

##Individual Analysis - Due by midnight, day of presentation

Same as always....

* How did the project your Team created represent/do/enact (verb is your choice) Black Code Studies (this should be the longest answer, at least 750 words)
* What process did your Team use to create your project?
* How did you participate in that process?
* What roles and responsibilities did members of the Team have? How were they defined?
* Is there anything else you want to add about the assignment, the final product, or your work with the team?

A reminder that your individual analysis is your opportunity to send me a private report of your work and reflect on anything missing from the final project itself.
