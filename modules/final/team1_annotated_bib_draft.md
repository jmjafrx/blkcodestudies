* Harris, Michael D. "Memories and memorabilia, art and identity." _Third Text_ 12, no. 44 (June 19, 2008): 25-42. June 19, 2008. Accessed April 18, 2017. doi:10.1080/09528829808576749.

In exploring analyzing of black people in cartoons and illustrations from the 19th century to the present, Harris explores the ways these stereotypical images fuel and substantiate racial ideologies. Counter-hegemonic visual, verbal, and literary efforts are also discussed. This article provides specific phenotypic and symbolic ways in which the black body and presence has been used it creative settings, and can be useful in our discussions of black animated character representation. 

* Lehman, Christopher P. “Introduction,” in *The Colored Cartoon: Black Representation in American Animated Short Films, 1907-1954,* (University of Massachusetts Press, 2007), 1-4.

In the introduction of _The Colored Cartoon: Black Representation in American Animated Short Films, 1907-1954,_ Lehman makes the claim that animation would not exist without black people, he goes on to also discuss what he will cover in the rest of his novel. This source will be used as a starting point for the conversation on black representation in animation. 

* David Pilgrim, Dr. " The Mammy Caricature." Jim Crow Museum: The Mammy Caricature. October 2000. Accessed April 20, 2017. http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/mammies/.

This article discusses various historical, fictional and commercial portrayals of Mammie as early as 1905. Pilgrim explains that Mammie, in these contexts, has been more than a crude caricature of black women, but a figure representing the inappropriate amelioration of the greater black American struggle to sooth the “white man’s guilt”. In our future discussions about black character representation in animation, we can compare this article’s descriptions of Mammie as a tool, rather than a human being, with the uses of black characters in animation today, as tools to “diversify” rather than characters to entertain. 


* Tucker, Jeffrey A. “Contending Forces: Racial and Sexual Narrative in _Dhalgren_,” in _A Sense of Wonder: Samuel R. Delany, Race, Identity, and Difference,_ (Wesleyan University Press, 2004), 55-89.

Throughout the second chapter of *A Sense of Wonder: Samuel R. Delany, Race, Identity, and Difference,* Tucker discusses the racial and sexual nuances that are present in Samuel Delany’s *Dhalgren,* a science fiction book that received mass amounts of critical acclaim. This source will be used both as a conversation topic in podcasts concerning black people in science fiction and as a source of inspiration for poetry, both of these found on tumblr. 

* West, Carolyn M. "Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire and their homegirls: Developing an ‘oppositional gaze’ toward the images of Black women." _Lectures on the Psychology of Women_, no. 4 (2012): 286-299, Accessed April 10, 2017. http://works.bepress.com/DrCarolynWest/15/.

In this lecture, West breaks down three historical American caricatures of black women: the Mammy, the Jezebel and the Sapphire. She then takes those concepts and discusses how they evolved into more contemporary images and discusses how each of these images has a negative effect on not only the general perception of black women, but the mental health and emotional expression of black women themselves. This work will be included in the discussion of where present day film/TV show black female characters come from, historically, and why these images are harmful.

) Television Program._Winx Club_, Season 1 Episode 12, September 4, 2004. 

This episode clip is taken from season 1, episode 12 of the original Winx Club English dub. In the video we see a black character named Aisha having a meltdown because her normally straighter hair had suddenly been turned into an afro by some witches. This video is being cited as an example of anti-blackness and misogynoir in fictional representations of black women. 

* Diana Mafe, [“Where Are the Black Women in Speculative Film and Television? | Diana Mafe | TEDxDenisonU.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATnvWZFDoP0 ) YouTube Video, 14:13. Posted by “TEDx Talks,” April 26, 2016. 

This TEDx Talk was done by Professor Diana Mafe from Denison University and she speaks about the lack of visibility and variety in black female characters in quality speculative film and fiction as leading roles despite the boundless possibilities that the genre offers. We chose to include this video as a source because she references so many contemporary examples of speculative fiction that we can draw from in our own discussions and she lays out a brief summary of how black women are portrayed in these contexts to give us an idea of how to interpret the few roles that black women have.

* Barron Preston, [“Where Are All the Black Superheros?”](https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/where-are-all-the-black-superheroes/589cb69c5b7f9b5d01e5c3d9
) VICE Video, 3:48, Posted by “Daily VICE,” Feburary 10, 2017.

This video showcases a comic book artist by the name of Ron Wimberly whose book is being featured at the 5th annual black comic book festival in Central Harlem. Preston asks Wimberly a series of questions that all stem from blackness, underrepresentation, and black history month. This source will be used in conjunction with Jeffrey Tucker piece when discussing how black artists make their own spaces where space doesn’t seem available.
