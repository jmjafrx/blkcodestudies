## Text Entries

* Blassingame, John W. *Black New Orleans, 1860-1880.* Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008.

Blassingame's *Black New Orleans, 1860-1880* uses census records, newspapers, and nineteenth-century enslaved testimony to narrate the history of people of African descent in New Orleans. This text is being used as background research for text post Tumblr content and questions for podcast interviews. 

* Dayan, Joan. “Codes of Law and Bodies of Color.” *New Literary History* 26, no. 2 (1995): 283–308. doi:10.1353/nlh.1995.0020.

Dayan's article "Codes of Law" describes how slave codes in the French Caribbean were created out of conflict over enslaved women's sexual ties with white men, and the perceived threat black women posed to society. This text is being used as background research for text post Tumblr content and questions for podcast interviews.

* Ruddick, Sue. “In Memory of Clyde Woods: Racing Neoliberalism and Its Long Durée.” *Antipode Foundation*, December 3, 2012. http://antipodefoundation.org/2012/12/03/the-sun-never-set-upon-the-blues-seven-essays-honouring-clyde-woods/.

Ruddick's essay, in memory of Clyde Woods death, summarizes Woods work on blues epistemology, black New Orleans, and black California. This text is being used as background research on blues epistemology, which is the guiding principle behind our data visualization. 

## Non-Text Entries

*Non-Text entries in Chicago Style are trickier - see this guide. Information that must be present: creator/artist, title, year, gallery, copyright for the image you are using if applicable. Also best to include a copy of the entry (embed image or link to video/audio)*

* Alison Saar, *Cotton Eater*, 2013; ceramic, acrylic, graphite, and cotton balls; Museum of the African Diaspora, New York; Copyright Alison Saar, Images courtesy of L.A. Louver, Venice, CA

![Saar Cotton Eater Entry #1](https://github.com/blackcodestudies/blkcodestudies/modules/final/Saar_Cotton-Eater-head.png)

Alison Saar is the daughter of another artist we discussed in class, Betye Saar. Her multimedia work *Cotton Eater* is an example of the kind of work we want to showcase on our black art Tumblr, and, with its vestiges of slavery, Jim Crow, and black death, an example of how Black Code Studies might operate in analog art form. 

* Crissle and Kid Fury, "[You're Just a Baby Boy](https://soundcloud.com/theread/youre-just-a-baby-boy)," *This is the Read*, New York, NY, 2016 

Crissle and Kid Fury host a weekly podcast called *This is the Read* that, while for entertainment, offers insightful analysis of everything from pop culture to politics. This episode, in particular the section beginning at minute 35 where Kid Fury is "reading" Tyrese for his views on black women, is being used as an example of how to critique in a comedic and black vernacular fashion topics like feminism, misogynoir, and queer life and culture, the same topics we want to highlight in our podcast and text Tumblr entries.
