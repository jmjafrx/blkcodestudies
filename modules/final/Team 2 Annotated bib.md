* Gilchrist, Marquelle-Turner, "The New Stereotype: The Reclaim" Vimeo, Video by Marcus Rosendoll, https://vimeo.com/147184226 

This video features a group of young black male professionals dressed up in fitted suits carrying tan laptop bags. This video promotes the "new stereotype" of black men as hard working, intelligent individuals. The theme  is closely associated with the #BlackExcellence to both dismiss the image of black men as not working and promotes the image of successful men. Through fashion, the professionals in the video demonstrate how art can be a catalyst in positive representations of black men.

* Kast, Shelia. “The Politics of Archiving #blacklivesmatter” Maryland Morning series, WYPR, May 15, 2015 http://wypr.org/post/politics-archiving-blacklivesmatter

In this podcast, they discuss the advantages of archiving these different artifacts from the still going #blacklivesmatters. One of the drawback they say using online platforms is the lack of search function and wondering how it can be useful for all researchers. The MD Historical society states their archive is better because it will be searchable and they will have metadata. To compensate this we will use a theme on the Tumblr that allows searching and put to heavy use the hashtag function.

*Jennifer A. Gonzalez, Subject to Display: Reframing Race in Contemporary Installation Art, 11-20 + an assigned chapter per pair of students TBD. Boston, MA: MIT Press, 2008.

In this piece, Jennifer A. Gonzalez  debates whether black art should be explained in away that the artist is speaking from inside the community and speaking to the outside something like an identity project or is it a ethnographic study of the artists’ speaking like an anthropologist making a public statement on blackness from the outside looking in. This reading specifically helps us understand how we examine black art  especially when the black art is retaking a stereotype that has been historically used to demean the black community.
