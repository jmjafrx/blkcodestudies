# Final Project Submission Guidelines

Due: May 18th by midnight

Your guidelines are as follows:

1. Submit a Markdown file with a link to the final project for review.
2. Add to this folder any supplementary files or documents you created that you'd like to be part of your evaluation. Examples: Any videos, podcast files, research notes (group or individual), outlines, image files, csv files, data sets, even external websites that inspired the project, etc. that your team used to craft and develop the final project. 
3. Feel free to add any individual notes or reflections on your team or the work you created here as well.
4. 500 word Individual Reflections on the project and/or the class should be sent to me by email jmj@jhu.edu. This is your final opportunity to address to me, privately, anything you need to about the project, your team, or the course as a whole.

Consider this your final project submission, but also a folder of the research you did to bring the project together into its current form. The research notes and material don't have to be well composed or organized. They can be messy. What you want is for me to be able to see and follow your process easily. 

You can drag and drop from your desktop with no problem. If you have links, add them to the Markdown file. You are also welcome to link to Google or Dropbox folders if that is easier.

BONUS: For those planning to continue with their projects and/or with the Black Code Studies project overall, please include the following in your Markdown file:

"We, the undersigned, have decided as a team that we do want our project included in the Black Code Studies overall venture and we would like to designate __[insert team member name and post-Hopkins email address if applicable]_____ as the team liason to Black Code Studies after this class if over. Signed: ______[each team member's name]_____" 

* If each team member would like to be a liasion, that's fine.
* If you'd like to include language about the responsibility of the team member to the team after the class is over, or to the integrity of the project after the class is over, logistics on reporting back, etc., that is also fine and this is a good time (while you are stil together) to work out those details. 

Dr. Neal and I will consider this statement permission from you to remain in contact and to include the project (or some iteration of it, as decided in cahoots with the team liaision) after class is over. 

It has been my pleasure to serve as your professor in this course. Best of luck, all of you, in all of your future adventures.

Warmly,
Dr. Johnson
