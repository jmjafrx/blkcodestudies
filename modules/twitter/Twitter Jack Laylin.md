# Twitter Assignment

### Notes
I created a new account. It asked for the phone number (“to connect me with friends”/sell my information/help me when I lose my password), a username and password, and then some interests to tailor my timeline. There was a password strength checker and phone and email verification. The login process does not differ much from Tumblr. It might even be identical.

I selected a bunch of different interests, including digital creators, US News, design and architecture, government and politics, black community, style, and movies.

The interfaces are also largely the same, with widgets for exploring things you do not follow, a semi-chronological list of updates from people you do follow, customizable avatars and cover photos. 

### Reflection

I created a public list for @blkcodestudies to follow. I added Ava Duvernay, Alicia Garza, the Baltimore Police, the UN Refugee Agency, and Gloria Steinem. There are tons of news accounts out there but I thought these would provide the most relevant news for black historians, feminists, activists, and whistleblowers. Duvernay, in the vanguard of black film narratives, is a role model and power figure who is deeply involved in the black media consciousness. Alicia Garza, creator of #blacklivesmatter, is a prolific tweeter, hater-shut-downer, and social commentator. Also on the list is the BPD, because we need understand what goes on in our city from the seat of power and on the streets. I added UN Refugee Agency because the refugee crisis cannot be ignored in bliss, the same way police brutality, systemic racism, and xenophobia cannot. Finally, the ageless Gloria Steinem for her endless support for women of all colors and creeds, to remind us that “the most neglected person in America is the black woman” (to borrow from Malcolm X).

I learned that Twitter does not have a general unsubscribe feed like Tumblr, which all users see. The differences in post length and formatting are also glaringly obvious. But strong similarities in the form of reblogging/reposting, liking/hearting, following, and replying all demonstrate how little separates the two platforms.

We have not discussed the police at length yet, but I think the Twitter module will change that. Twitter is a stronghold for mass organization in response to events like Ferguson, Freddie Grey’s murder, and the Zimmerman trial. I remember in the WIRED article we read for today that was a sentence about police monitoring Black Lives Matter activist accounts for intelligence ahead of protests. Tumblr isn’t used for this purpose on nearly the same scale. I think Twitter content is more about conversation while Tumblr content is more about blogging and creating permanent content. Tumblr is not as ephemeral, and therefore is not as current. The police do not monitor it in the same way, and protestors definitely do not organize on Tumblr in the same quantities as they do on Twitter.
