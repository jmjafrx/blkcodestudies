## Twitter Archive: Team 1
#### (Created by Turquoise Baker)

This archive is on a Google Docs Spreadsheet, and tracks the hashtags #blackcodestudies and #BFAP from the @blkcodestudies account. I found "Twitter Archiver" easier to access than the IFTTT because I already had a Google account and have used Google Spread Sheets before. The link to the spreadsheet is [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p977lKL939vtQD2halhERZZXjWMkMKZteh7HSPWEUeg/edit?usp=sharing) (anyone with the link can view).
