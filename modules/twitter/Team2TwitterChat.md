##Speaker and Hashtag

1.  Who is our speaker?

* 	[__Amandla Stenberg__](https://twitter.com/amandlastenberg) -  Why? A literal badass. She has her own website, and under the about her tag she writes on the meaning of her name which is ‘power’ in Zulu. She’s considered one of the faces of the millennial generation as a full blown activist at the age of 18. Her breakthrough role as Rue in the Hunger Games trilogy enabled her to go on and appear in Beyonce’s Lemonade, as well as her most recent movie As You Are. Her activism became prominent with her school project video ‘Don’t Cash Crop My Cornrows’ on cultural appropriation. Oprah invited her to give a talk entitled ‘My Authenticity Is My Activism’. A youth ambassador for No Kid Hungry and the 2016 Feminist Celebrity of the Year, Amandla has taken part in various initiatives to bring the topics of racism, privilege, and charity to the table. 

2.  What is our conversation's hashtag?

*	Celebrity Millennial Activism. Many of the most powerful people on social media are celebrities. Some of them use that platform for good, like organizing protests, distributing political relevant content, making political statements, and coming to the defense of others who have experienced discrimination.
*	It’s important to emphasize the millennial aspect to show that the age group that has been blamed for countless trends and mishaps this century is actually trying to promote positive change.
