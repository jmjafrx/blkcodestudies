**Twitter Assignment #1**

*Notes*

1. Back in 2015, my roommate and a friend created a Twitter for me. I am not exactly sure what was asked of me. I remember when I first used Twitter, my Facebook friends and contacts appeared which I assume means that my friends gave Twitter access to my contacts. I set my profile to private. 

2. As I tweet infrequently on Twitter, I think my friends selected that option for me. My timeline has a lot of tweets from January 20. I was and still am in my feelings regarding those unfortunate events. I think Twitter’s workspace is easier to track and more ascetically pleasing. 

3. I have changed my profile pic and cover photo for fun. Tumblr and Twitter both display users’ social media preferences. Both platforms offer suggested individuals for the account owner to follow. Finding profiles to follow on Twitter was not as difficult as finding Tumblr blogs to follow. I think Twitter is more popular than Tumblr. It is easier to use. 

*Reflection*

I followed, @WGNUnderground, @jhu_africana, @LBS Baltimore, @AssatasDaughters and @ShaunKing. 

We watched an episode of Underground for class, so it made since for me to follow this account. I added the show’s profile to my list for a few reasons. WGN is heavily promoting the show’s upcoming season, which gives new viewers an opportunity to catch up on the storyline written in season 1. Further, during this season of Underground, the Macon 7 will encounter Harriet Tubman. The dramatization of Tubman will be one of the few portrayals of Tubman to exist in either television or film. It is important that any black code studies Twitters support depictions of resistance against slavery, especially for television programs or films that relate to our class themes. 

The Center for Africana Studies is the only institution at Hopkins dedicated to engaging in scholarship on the African diaspora. The Center’s affiliated staff and events touch upon many of the themes mentioned in our previous class discussions. However, CAS remains confined by institutional policies and practices that make it difficult for the Center to become a more robust repository of knowledge. I think blkcodestudies should use the Center as a resource for info while remembering that the Center is still a university apparatus. 

Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle is a grassroots think-tank with a community organizing mission in Black communities. LBS is a resistance group, one that uses direct actions politics to challenge white supremacy and its consequence. LBS also has a strong youth focus and seeks to advance public policy reform through the involvement of young generation and connecting liberation politics and popular culture. 

Assata’s Daughters is another grassroots collective dedicated to liberation politics. The collective takes its name from Black liberation icon Assata Shakur, unjustly accused of murdering a New Jersey State trooper. Assata’s Daughters challenge the American police state, train young women on radical Black feminist politics and teach community organizing skills. I think initiatives led by Black women are sometimes ignored in media. For example, @deray has 705K Twitter followers to @aliciagarza’s 41.9k followers. Hell, Alicia does not even have an official “celebrity” check that Twitter offers Deray and other “celebrities.”

Shaun King is a reporter/writer for the NY Daily News. He writes articles on race and politics for the publication. I think these accounts represent individuals or institutions who challenge conventional ideology about race and racial privilege. 

Twitter values simplicity. The concept is more straight forward than Tumblr. The search and following process on Twitter is more user friendly than Tumblr. Twitter always makes suggestion for users to follow, such as possible publications, foundations and individuals who may interest users. Tumblr offers suggested blogs, but does no overwhelm its user with a ton of suggestions. While I am sure that I can change my Tumblr background, I fear that the process is more complicated than I would like it to be. I do not know if I can change my Twitter cover theme from white to something else. However, I changed my profile’s theme color and added a cover photo of NYC’s skyline.
