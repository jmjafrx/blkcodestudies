## Twitter Module: Team 1 (Channing, Tejiri, Turquoise)

1. When brainstorming ideas last week, we contemplated creating a bot that would generate facts and images Afro-Futurist art in all mediums. However, this exceeded the abilities of the free bot website we used for the project. Including #afrofuturism allows us to keep traces of our original ideas while adhering to the capabilities of the platform. Our profile image of Janelle Monae on the cover of her album, _Archandroid_, serves to represent our Afro-Futurist theme. “Sousveillance”, one of the major themes of the course, was also something we were interested in, so we included it as well. 

2. How did you configure the bot to do this work?
    * We set the bot to track “#afrofuturism” and “sousveillance”. The bot is active 24/7 (12 am to 12 am). 
    * Twitter handle: @altffffff, can be found here: https://twitter.com/altffffff 
    * Our bot is linked and named after our team’s tumblr page “altffffff”, as well as the email associated with the bot: bcs.altffffff@gmail.com.
