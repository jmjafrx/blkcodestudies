## Twitter Assignment #1 | Channing Kimble-Brown

### Step 1 - skipped because I just used a twitter account I already had

---
### Step 2 - Notes on using Twitter
* I tried to follow @blkcodestudies on Twitter but for some reason it didn't come up on regular search and the professor had to link me to it (have to ask about that on Monday).
* In the process of trying to figure out which 5 accounts I wanted in my list, I started by scrolling through the list of people I already follow and pretty much found everyone on my list form doing that.

### Short Reflection

**Justification - Why did you choose the accounts you did?**

* [@afamhistfail](https://twitter.com/afamhistfail) - This account is run by a black woman (I believe) that has experience working as a tour guide for various museums and attractions about slavery in the Southern United States. Reading this account's tweets is always educational and entertaining and really makes you aware of how clueless people can be about African American history, even aggressively so and especially when it comes to slavery. 
* [@BreeNewsome](https://twitter.com/BreeNewsome) - Bree Newsome climbed to the top of the flag pole in South Carolina and removed the Confederate flag with nothing but her hands and a harness! She's inspirational and gave us a great modern day example of civil disobedience.
* [@JoyAnnReid](https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid) - Joy Ann Reid is a political commentator who hosts a talk show on MSNBC. I feel like she brings a political expertise to the mix without throwing her blackness under the bus. She's also a good person to follow to keep up to date with what's happening in the government.
* [@thetrudz](https://twitter.com/thetrudz) - I just personally enjoy following Trudy, I discovered her after finding her (now inactive) Tumblr GradientLair. She often has wells of knowledge and wisdom when it comes to Intersectional Feminism and Womanism in all aspects of life but at the same time it's nice to follow someone that talks about more mundane things like their favorite tv shows or what kind of recipes they recommend. She serves as a reminder to me that being socially aware has to be balanced with joy and comfort to remain sane.
* [@Lexual__](https://twitter.com/Lexual__) - I actually discovered Elexus Jionde somewhat recently but I love her content. She posts 2 minute black history lessons about topics that are often not covered in primary or secondary school and I have learned a lot from following her for just a few weeks.

**Why should @blkcodestudies follow the accounts you picked?**

* [@afamhistfail](https://twitter.com/afamhistfail) - I feel like this account really emphasizes why black code studies and classes like it are so important. There are way too many people walking around thinking that some of the slave masters were "nice to their slaves" and not being fully aware of how brutal our history is.
* [@BreeNewsome](https://twitter.com/BreeNewsome) - This account ties to the theme of resistance. While South Carolinian representatives were debating whether or not to take the flag down Bree Newsome used her own agency to make the decision for them and continues to be an activist promoting anti-racism to this day.
* [@JoyAnnReid](https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid) - She provides some very astute political perspective on a lot of issues and policies affecting black people, which is relevant to our goal of understanding how present day black codes are working, even if that isn't what they are called.
* [@thetrudz](https://twitter.com/thetrudz) - I think she's just really cool but she also talks talks about a wide variety of topics affecting black people, whether it be race, sexuality, gender, ability, education, class, etc. 
* [@Lexual__](https://twitter.com/Lexual__) - She has very similar goals as our class does, to provide some historical context in an accessible format to teach people about black history. Her work is well researched and trustworthy in addition to just being really interesting.

**What did you learn about how Twitter operates from signing on?**

* I don't really remember when I first signed on back in 2009 but going about the assignment I learned that Twitter even had lists to begin with. I've always used it just to follow people and read their tweets and retweets. I didn't even start retweeting or liking tweets until like last October and I only did so to show things to show things I found intersting to my little sister (the only person I let follow me at the moment). I have yet to make an original tweet so I'm practically a rookie when it comes to doing more than simple searches and following people. 

**Pick a theme we've already discussed in this course (example: resistance) and consider: How does Twitter compare to Tumblr?**

* _Resistance_ - On Twitter is much more about organizing for real life action in real time than I'd say Tumblr is. If you wanted to learn more about a rally currently happening in DC then Twitter is definitely the place to look. Since the medium lends itself to quick little messages it is way easier to disseminate small bits of information quickly to a lot of people. Hashtags are also another tool that lend themselves much better to resistance. On Twitter, hashtags are much more concise and consistent and make it really easy to sort relevant information. Tumblr allows so many tags on one post that they aren't nearly as helpful and the posts in question often cover way more topics than one tweet might so it is a bit harder to target specific information quickly. Tumblr is more about long form posts slowly making its way around the user base. Any resistance unique to Tumblr would probably be long text posts on how current events are personally affecting users from various marginalized communities or similar posts just listing or planning various forms of resistance. I'd also say that Twitter resistance is more about group organization whereas Tumblr resistance is much more about resisting by celebrating the individual, though there is definitely overlap.
