## Twitter Assignment #1: Turquoise Baker 

Note: I had a twitter before this Black Codes Studies

### @BET

- I wanted to follow an account which had a primary focus in Black media and chose BET. Looking through their feed, they seem to bring attention to many new black artists, actors, and musicians while also recognizing the veterans in these fields. Furthermore, most of the other accounts on my list are fairly political, and I thought having a different type of account would balance out my selection. 


### @deray (DeRay Mckesson) 

- DeRay Mckesson, civil rights activist, educator, and influential advocate for the Black Lives Matter Movement. Last October, he came to Johns Hopkins to speak about his experiences working in the Baltimore education system and organizing events and campaigns for Black Lives Matter. Although his feed does have a few funny videos or retweets, he continuously encourages action outside of social media, especially with his "Resistance Manual" (link in his twitter bio), which covers everything from Disability Rights, Educational Justice and current nation policy changes. The site is usually updated daily. 

### @MHarrisPerry (Melissa Harris-Perry)

- Melissa Harris-Perry is a Professor at Wake Forest University, editor at Elle Magazine, Executive Director of the “Pro Humanitate Institute” at Wake Forest and a great deal more. Her twitter is filled with articles, videos, interviews, and that allow black voices to be heard. In 2016, after claiming that there was a heavy racial aspect regarding her treatment on the cable news channel, she was asked to leave. She continues to speak out about the prejudice she faced during her time in the news industry.

### @JohnsHopkins

- I think we should definitely follow JHU on twitter. Understanding the experience of blacks in America and elsewhere can be much easier if we understand the environment around us.

### @OfficialCBC

- The Congressional Black Caucus was founded in 1971. They are amongst the strongest advocates for black rights in America and are influential in American politics. Their feed consists of interviews, official letters, news articles and even hashtags like "#Letlizspeak" after Senator Warren was silenced on the floor. It is important to understand what is happening around us and the news that is being made, but I think we should also pay attention to the individuals who are working hard to change the system and make the news. 

### Reflection

- I honestly don't know much (if anything at all) about twitter, besides the fact that one can only use 140 characters. But having looked around a bit, I see that is possible to offer access to good content even with the word limit. I think the accounts on my list can help diversify the way we understand the black expeience in America, Baltimore, and even just on social media.
