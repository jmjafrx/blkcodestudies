#Step A - Make an App for the Twitter Bot

1. Create a new account at Twitter that will work as a bot. 

2. Go to apps.twitter.com, sign-in with your new Twitter account and create a Twitter app. Give your app a name, description and put any URL in the website field. Agree to the developer terms and submit the form.

3. Once the Twitter app has been created, click Modify App Permissions under Application Settings and change the access level to Read, Write and Access Direct Messages. 

4. Next switch to the Keys and Access Tokens tab and click the Create my Access Token button. Twitter will generate the Consumer Keys and Access tokens that we will need in a next step.


#Step B: Configure your Twitter bots

1. Go to labnol.org/bots to open the Twitter bots application. You may have to authorize the bot once.

2. Edit the values of Twitter Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Secret to insert the values that were generated in the previous step.

3. Specify the search phrase for the bots. Here you can follow a hashtag or a Twitter account. You can replies, retweets  The app will find all new tweets that match this search phrase and process them all, one at a time. (This tool has a premium version--stick with the free version and create only one bot)

*This is where what you've learned in #BlackCodeStudies comes in. What will you have your bot do? What work do you want the bot to do/create once it is running? How long will it take for that work to manifest--one retweet? Five? As a team, your bot isn't successful just because it runs. It is succesful because it somehow does the work that we've been learning in this class along themes we've discussed often--undercommoning, fugitivity, resistance, surveillance, sousveillaince, decommodification, etc.*

You can use [Twitter search operators](https://www.labnol.org/internet/twitter-search-tricks/13693/) to find more specific tweets for processing through bots. For instance, use min_faves or min_retweets operator to filter out spammy tweets from search results. There are other tricks and tools, you are welcome to use any you find.

Click the Create to initialize the Twitter bot. 

The bot will run over the course of spring break. When we return on the Monday after break, we will discuss what you've created, what the results were, and whether your stated goal was successful.

#REPORT

By 12 noon Monday, March 20, 2017 (you are ENCOURAGED to submit this early and before), commit to the Twitter folder on git the following:

1. What is the goal of the bot you created? What work do you want it to do?

2. How did you configure the bot to do this work?

3. The username for the bot (so we can all follow her/him/them/it).

Don't forget to add your team number and members of the team who were involved. 


That’s it. The bots are now initialized and they’ll auto-run in the background.
