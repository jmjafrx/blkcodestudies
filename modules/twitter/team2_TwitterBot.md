#Twitter Mod: Black Art

###Team 2: Kwame Alston, Jonathan Brown, Megan Huynh, Jack Laylin Dikshant Malla, Zoya Sattar

1. What is the goal of the bot you created? What work do you want it to do?

We wanted for it to gather up tweets on black art. Black art that captures resilience, black art that upholds resistance, black art that gets taken by white people and passed off as their own to become the next pop culture phenomenon. We wanted to document the essence of this black artwork on Twitter by gathering it at its source. 

2. How did you configure the bot to do this work?

The group configured the bot to retweet all tweets containing the hashtag "blackart." We did not limit the retweets in the bot to only tweets with #blackart that had been retweeted  a certian amount of times because we wanted to capture all that twitter had to offer. Hopefully out bot is the only giving these artist a platform or helping with the minimum amount of retweets needed for another bot tracking the same thing. This however will cause us to backtrack and make sure the content we want to be retweeted is being retweeted. It would have been helpful to have the premium service that allowed for 5 different bots at once. 

3.	The username for the bot (so we can all follow her/him/them/it).
