#Twitter Assignment #1 - Kwame Alston
##Notes
* Step 2:

I am not very new to twitter so finding the account was very easy. There seems to be an account called @BlkCodeCollective that I was really confused about. I have a hard time seeing things that are right in front of my face, so it was very hard for me to find the list button and then it was very hard for me to find the "create list" feature. 

Here are some accounts I looked at before making a final decision.

*  [@Blackity](https://twitter.com/Blavity)  
*  [@TheRoot](https://twitter.com/TheRoot)  
*  [@Blackbirds](https://twitter.com/Blackbirds)
*  [@WORLDSTAR](https://twitter.com/WORLDSTAR)
*  [@MichelleObama](https://twitter.com/MichelleObama)
*  [@BarackObama](https://twitter.com/BarackObama)
*  [@LBSBaltimore](https://twitter.com/LBSBaltimore?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
*  [@Bmore_United](https://twitter.com/Bmore_United)
*  [@SmartBlackMan](https://twitter.com/SmartBlackMan)  
*  [@TomiLahren](https://twitter.com/TomiLahren)

*  [@KimberyNFoster](https://twitter.com/KimberlyNFoster)  
*  [@Blklivesmatter](https://twitter.com/Blklivesmatter)  
*  [@BlkMillennials](https://twitter.com/BlkMillennials)

This list is rather diverse and even includes some popular racist. It was hard but I was able to pull 5 from the list. Hopefully other students will use some  of the ones I did not.

##REFLECTION

The account I have chosen are the following

*  [@Blklivesmatter](https://twitter.com/Blklivesmatter)  

The account was chosen because the account is the representation of a worldwide moment advocating for black lives. I would have chosen the 3 women who created the hashtag launching movement, but I was only given 5 spaces.

*  [@SmartBlackMan](https://twitter.com/SmartBlackMan)

Adam Jackson is the CEO of the non-profit Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle. He is a Baltimore based activist that has no problem calling out black Baltimore officials. I find his insight on different issues to be refreshing. I wanted my list to include at least one person that talked about issues facing Baltimore since I am from the city and Hopkins occupies space in the city. Admittedly he does have hotep tendencies.

*  [@KimberlyNFoster](https://twitter.com/KimberlyNFoster)

I absolutely adore Kimberly Foster. The content she is creating is not only thought provoking but extremely insightful. I love her commentary on hotep black men and the way she seems to be able to tackle all topics. 


* [@TheRoot](https://twitter.com/TheRoot)

I wanted to include The Root because it is a fairly reliable source for Black News. I wanted to include two different news sources. 

* [@Blavity](https://twitter.com/Blavity)

Blavity is one of secret favorites. I stated earlier that I wanted to include two different new sources, one serious and the other more lighthearted. Blavity is the lighthearted news source. I think that the list should include lots of thought provoking activist and intellectual articles, but we all desire a break to have fun. Celebrity gossip always makes the soul warm. 

@blkcodestudies should follow the accounts I picked because it is a great combination of different aspects of black life. [Kwame’s Blackety Black Blk Code Studies List](https://twitter.com/ijustquame/lists/blk-code-studies-remix) has two young intellectuals talking about their thoughts on black life, the Black Lives Matter movement page, and it also includes two very different new sources. These accounts give a diverse look into black culture. All of these accounts would brighten up any timeline (TL).

Twitter has a lot of coding for what they you would like. Your TL is rarely a live feed when you first log on. It is a collection of tweet the website algorithm thinks you would like and they are from the past. This is found on the web, mobile, and app. Tumblr is a constant live stream and doesn’t do much with the past.

In terms of themes and how the platforms handle them Twitter is a munch different place than Tumblr simply because the stark differences the platforms. Tumblr is a much more visual site. Despite the ability to use multiple different types of post photos are the most used post type. Also adding commentary on Tumblr is not easy to do on twitter. Twitter's 140 character limit and reply function allow for a conversation. In terms of resistance I feel like twitter has a larger platform. Black twitter seems to be as a whole just a powerful for force of resistance. It's a space occupied by black people that are setting trends. Tumblr seems to have images or blogs devoted to resistance, but the whole institution of black tumblr does not represent resistance in my eyes the way twitter does.
