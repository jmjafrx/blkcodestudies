## Twitter Archive: Team 3
#### Kwame Alston
 
 I decided that the Twitter Archiver Tool was the more intuitive tool to use for this project. The only downside being that without paying for the premium service I could only record one rule at a time.  To make up for this I created a rule that would capture all tweets replying to or @ the account then deleted that rule and created a rule to capture all the tweets made by the account. I thought it would be easier to just capture all the tweets since were using different hashtags and not everyone always used the hashtags in the tweets. 

This archive utilizes Google Spreadsheets, so it is easily accessible and sharable with the entire team. [CLICK HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L9OJUv1eAg6Gv2UgyUjKsVSZ8qqwpabv6e5X8SQDjWs/edit?usp=sharing) to to go the spreadsheet.
