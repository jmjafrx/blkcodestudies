# Twitter Assignment
* I am using my personal twitter account so I started at step 2, when I first open my browser on the right hand side it suggests that I follow three tennis players. I mainly use my twitter to follow up on tennis and general sports news so it was no surprise that it wanted me to follow tennis players. 

# Reflection
* First, I choose to follow the documentary 13th because it provides important information on prison labor and how the passage of the 13 Amendment functionally legalized slavery. I think that is quite educational and something we do not often hear/learn about in classrooms so I figured the account would continue to provide important information. I choose Black Lives Matter because I think any discussion of social media, and activism is incomplete without including Black Lives Matter. I choose Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle because they are an organization that I have closely worked with and believe their mission of advancing public policy interest for black people in Baltimore provides crucial information about the integration of race in policy that we ought to discuss. I picked Dylan Rodriguez, professor at UC Riverside, because I read some of this scholarship on prison abolition in my early college years and I think he provides an academic perspective on prison life and prison abolition that could help us understand the subject more. Finally, I picked Catherine Pugh because as the Mayor of Baltimore she has a lot of power and influence regarding the lives of black individuals in the city, that much power requires us to pay some attention to her. 

* @blkcodestudies should follow the accounts I picked because ir provides a holistic perspective on both historical and current state of black live. I think the accounts I have picked speak on a wide range of issues from individuals/organizations who have unique experiences discussing the topic. I think having this wide variety of experience in profession and work of interest allows us as a class to be better informed about various issues. 

* Based on my sporadic use of twitter through the years, I have found out that the main page on tiwtter operates mainly through hashtags. On the right side of the page, there is a trending list that you can modify based on your location. There is also a suggested follow page that suggests accounts I should follow based on who I currently follow.

* The theme I picked was #12YearsASlave. One major difference I noticed between tumblr and twitter is that while tumblr shows the post popular posts at the top of the page, twitter has various options where you can view tweets based on the "top" or ones that are the "latest". Another feature that is different on twitter is that even when you look at the "top" tweets of #12YearsASlave, they are top tweets from the current month not tweets since 2013 (when the movie first came out) whereas tumblr just has the most popular posts.
