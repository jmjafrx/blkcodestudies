# Twitter Module
*	Ask if I want my feed to be customized to past pages I have visited
*	What are you interested in?
*	Want to find friends and see who they follow? From gmail or outlook
*	Make your timeline yours: follow some of the accounts below and you’ll see what they share in your timeline  they give you a bunch of different accounts you could potentitally follow based on who you said you wanted to follow or hwat interests you had
*	Also based on your location
*	Turn on notifications
*	Then a short tutorial about what you can do to interact on twitter
*	Didn’t notice any security protocols other than creating a secure password
*	The process is very similar to tumblr 
*	I think twitter’s interface is more understandable than tumblr’s 
*	Within 5 min of making my twitter account, it became locked because it “Your account appears to have exhibited automated behavior that violates the Twitter Rules. To unlock your account, please complete the steps below and confirm that you are the valid account owner.”
*	Needed to verify myself through my phone
*	Instead of offering to text, they automatically call you which is not very convenient.
*	The interfaces are fairly similar, but organized in different ways. The background in Twitter is bright and white whereas Tumblr is navy. To me, this difference sets the mood of the social media platform. In a way, the darkness of Tumblr symbolizes how Tumblr was originally a secretive and private platform for yourself – a place where you could express yourself anonymously and about anything. Twitter’s white background symbolizes more of an open-feeling where anyone can know who you are, what you are doing, and where you are. The interfaces are similar in a sense that many of the top icons are alike, such as the Home button, messages, moments/activity, Radar/Trends, and the button to create a post. Twitter’s interface is more understandable because the buttons are labeled better instead of Tumblr’s standalone icons. 


# Final Report

*	Mark Anthony Neal – his Twitter is always buzzing. He tweets about Black topics ranging from popular culture with movies to modern art to quotes of Malcom X. His array of tweets can peak the interest of anyone who wants to know what is important for someone studying Black Codes and the current news and information that is important in understanding Black Codes.

*	Solomon Northup Legacy – this Twitter reminds us of his Solomon’s story and how the remnants of slavery still prevail in our society. It celebrates the successes of landmark achievements such as The Harriet Tubman National Park of New York and promotes other human rights campaigns such as Awareness month for Human Trafficking. It is also a Twitter that helps with current day issue such as the airport detentions during the Muslim ban. 

*	Blue Lives Matter – I think the direct movement that sprouted as a result of Black Lives Matter Movement is important to follow. It can help understand what is being shown, retweeted, shared, etc. on the other side. The administrator(s) of this page seem to be very conservative and do not directly engage with the matter of Black Lives Matter. One thing to note about this account is that it has over 200,000 followers, yet only has about 48 tweets. The follower to tweet ratio is quite astonishing. This sheds light into how active this movement really is, and what kind of support they have on social media. 

*	Hollywood Black Film Festival – This account is important because, in popular culture, films featuring dominant Black casts are a dime a dozen. By following this account, someone studying Black Code Studies would be up to date about new movies coming out featuring Black actors and movies that showcase stories about hardships and success of Black characters. As discussed in class, films have been an amazing outlet for Black artists to prove their creativity and talents through art.

*	JHU Africana Studies – This account is important to be up to date with what is happening on-campus that pertain to Black Codes. It promotes its events, speaker series, and educational opportunities. With over 2,000 tweets, the JHU Africana Studies account is more active than many academic JHU accounts on Twitter. 

Twitter, like many other social media platforms, aims to customize the type of information you view and interact with every day. It wants to know what your interests are and what will make you not just a lurker on the internet but someone who is engaged. By asking to send you notifications, it wants to keep you attached to what happens on Twitter. It’s simple design and intuitive features make it easy for anyone to understand how to join Twitter and how to use Twitter.

Similar to what our readings this week touched upon about the Black Lives Matter Movement, is that Twitter is more powerful to igniting activism in communities than Tumblr can. Twitter is a real time discussion that acts and reacts to situations and stories very quickly. Twitter seems like a rawer social media platform in which users don’t really hold back in terms of the content that they post. It can be unedited, unchecked, and uncensored. People speak their mind, post photos and videos and discuss with other users actively. However, Tumblr seems to be a forum in which topics can be discussed and then reblogged, etc. Yet, Tumblr does not incite the same kind of viral-ness that Twitter content can do.
