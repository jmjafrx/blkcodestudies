#Twitter Module

##TEAMWORK: Due by 4:15 pm, March 9, 2017 

Your assignment for this module is in two parts:

##Part One - Black Surveillance

Watch and live tweet the premiere of Season #2 - #UndergroundWGN

Each Team should, from @blkcodestudies, organize themselves to live tweet the first episode of season two. 

Each tweet should use the hashtag #BlackCodeStudies and #t1, #t2, or #t3 depending on which team you are tweeting for. However, as Dr. Brown and Mr. Crutchfield explained, organizing twitter chats, live tweeting, and hashtags isn't as easy as it looks. Your team is responsible for organizing yourselves and creating a strategy for how they will live tweet the episode. Will you focus on corroborating events against historical sources available online? Will you take the celebrity route and explore the stage/screen history of the actors and actresses? Will you look at the music choices? The visuality? Technology of production? We will spend some time today discussing this and allowing you to map out the plan. 

REPORT BACK: How did your team organize yourselves, why did you make the choices you did? Use at least five of the texts that we have read (including films so far) to explain, justify, and critique your choices. 

##Part Two - Black Machines

Design a Twitter bot for Black Code Studies. Do not CREATE the Twitter bot.
