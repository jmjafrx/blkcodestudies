## Part 1: Twitter Chat

**Our guest:** Janelle Monae

**Why?** 

As a woman who has pushed the expectations of women and their role in the music industry by using Afrofuturism as her mode of expression, we felt that she would be the most appropriate interviewee in a Twitter chat. Her constant adaptability and new ideas make for an artist that is successful as she is elusive. 

**Some questions**
0. How do you feel that your aesthetic (black and white feminized masculine attire, and the staple red lip) has affected your brand and music? 
0. Is it difficult to stay true to your image or for others to accept your image in an industry where sex sells?
0. How has Afrofuturism influence your work? 
0. Which medium do you find most effective in conveying a statement about marginalization in Black America: music or film?
0. How do you deal with the constant surveillance of fans and misguided onlookers who feel they have a right to your body and time on social media?
0. Why is there such a focus on androids, as opposed to any other type of machine,  in your albums?
0. Have you received any backlash on your hairstyle(s)?
