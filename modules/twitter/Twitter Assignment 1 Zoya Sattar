### Stop and Write 1
I was unable to fulfill this as I have had this twitter for over two years now.

The main difference in Tumblr and Twitter's platforms would be the content. Tumblr is know for being a more visual experience, whereas Twitter is associated with short and snappy writings. While they both have the ability to reblog and like posts on each platform, the types of content that one is interacting with is vastly unalike. Also, in terms of profile, Tumble offers one an entire realm of possibilities to change one's blog too. Whereas with Twitter everyone's profiles look the same, with the only differences being specific content like tweets and profile information.

One of the first things I noticed when arriving upon the Black Code Studies twitter was that there were no tweets. The page showed that the account was following 21 others, such as the Baltimore Ravens and Joe Flacco, and that there were 2 people following the Twitter. Surprisingly, where it suggests people to follow, those who popped up were Taylor Swift, Harry Potter Film, and Alisa Drakes. It had been my previous experience that when typically viewing a twitter page, the suggested to follow tab on the side would show accounts that were at least semi-relevant to the account being viewed. 
On my profile itself at the time, the suggested to follow square showed Emma Watson, Elizabeth Warren, and Pottermore. I must admit, I am very surprised that so many Harry Potter related pages show up, as I don't recall ever being so vocal about Harry Potter on my Twitter. Also for the first time I realized that the trends I would see were tailored to fit my tastes, with #iammuslimtoo being the first one to appear. I'm not sure how I feel about having tailored trends. While I do enjoy seeing trends that are specific to my interests, I am also wary of staying a tunnel where the only echos I hear are similar to mine. Diversity of thought is one of the beauties of social media, and humanity at large, and I feel tailoring trends might take away from that. 
### Short Reflection
The accounts I chose for my list were JHU FAS,  Smithsonian NMAAHC, ACLU National, TED Talks, and Jelani Cobb. JHU FAS was chosen because I wanted to have something from the university included, and really value all the effort they place in bringing such renowned and riveting speakers from around the globe to our campus. The Smithsonian NMAAHC was an obvious choice, partially because I am visiting it this coming weekend, and also because I really enjoyed the reading in class that was on the idea and process of making the museum come to fruition. I liked TED Talks, partially because Chimamanda just visited campus. Also, I think the vastly different narratives shown in TED Talks are critical to bridging gaps and educating the masses. ACLU National seemed like an obvious choice given that we're living in turbulent times, and the fight for civil rights is a central theme in Black Code Studies. Jelani Cobb is a New Yorker Staff Writer who actively engages in discussion on Twitter dealing with issues from both the past and present. For example, on February 19 he went off on Twitter regarding the frequency of rape in slavery.
The main thread between all of the accounts is that they have to do with activism and civil rights, which are some of the key points expressed throughout the Black Code Studies course. 
I already knew how Twitter operated from my experience with it over the past few years, which is mostly through people having a conversation with each other through responses and retweets. 
When it comes to resistance, Twitter and Tumblr follow different standards. If you had to group both platform users, you could generally say that Tumblr is for the dreamers who fantasize of how the world could be, with some in depth discussion on injustice and how to correct this. Twitter is where the frustration boils over and allows action to take place. The 140 character limit means that people get to the point with what they have to say, which allows for a faster path to action.
