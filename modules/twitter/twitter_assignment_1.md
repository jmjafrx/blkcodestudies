#Assignment #1 - Who Follows Who?

##Due on GitHub [modules/twitter] by 12 Noon on Feb 21, 2017

This assignment will introduce you to Twitter

##Steps

###1. Create a Twitter account (skip to step #2 if you already have a Twitter account you’d like to use):

Go to [http://twiter.com](http://twitter.com) and sign up.

Fill in the requested information, including a username of your choice (keep in mind that your username is a matter of public record and will be seen by everyone in the course; choose accordingly). You may want to choose a username you can recreate across multiple platforms (i.e. Tumblr, Github).

**STOP & WRITE: In a few sentences, make note of the next steps you are asked to take before receiving an account.**

* Are you asked or encouraged to follow anyone?
* What security protocols are in place?
* How does the sign up and login process differ from Tumblr?

On Tumblr, your workspace is your “dashboard.” On Twitter, your workspace is your "timeline." Feel free to play around here for a bit, get comfortable. Can you change your profile picture? Your cover photo? Your template/background? This is your Twitter account and you're welcome to populate it with anything you wish. 

On both platforms, lay people call these spaces "profiles" and tech people call these spaces GUIs - Graphical User Interfaces. We can use interface for our purposes.

**STOP & WRITE: In a few sentences, compare and contrast Twitter and Tumblr's interfaces. What elements are the same? What is missing? What can you (the user) manipulate on the interface on one platform vs. the other? Make up a few questions of your own to ask.**

Finally - post your @username in the #twitter channel on Slack. 

###2. Follow, Follow Me

**STOP & Prepare to WRITE: For these next steps, document as much as you can--what pops up in your browser, where the Twitter platform leads you, etc.**

Follow the @blkcodestudies Twitter account.

That was easy. Right now - @blkcodestudies is an egg. Unhatched. We will hatch them later. First, we have to figure out who @blkcodestudies should follow.

Go back to your own Twitter profile to the search bar in the upper right hand side. Click your profile icon (it may be an egg or you may already have a profile pic) and scroll down to "lists." 

Using the lists feature on Twitter, create a list (you can name it what you want) of FIVE Twitter accounts @blkcodestudies should begin following. Things you should keep in mind:

* Existing themes of the class - slavery, resistance, fugitivity, history, black codes, violence, laws, police, prisons....and on and on
* Texts we've already looked at - Underground TV Series, 12 Years a Slave, Solomon Northrup
* Authors we've already read - Lonnie Bunch, Salamishah Tillet, Jasmine Cobb
* Hashagas we've already followed. Are there any we need to follow?
* Institutions - does Johns Hopkins have a Twitter account? Does the Smithsonian Museum of African American History? What other libriares, archives, media outlets, branches of government should @blkcodestudies follow?
* Are there accounts on Twitter that @blkcodestudies can't miss out on? 

Post a link to your Twitter list in the #Twitter channel on Slack. FOLLOW your classmates Twitter lists as they post them.

Your Twitter list URL will look something like this - [https://twitter.com/jmjafrx/lists/africana](https://twitter.com/jmjafrx/lists/africana)


###6. Final Report - post to git [modules/twitter]

Your final report includes - 
* The notes you took each time you stopped above

Short reflection - In at least 500 words: 
* Justification - Why did you choose the accounts you did? 
* Why should @blkcodestudies follow the accounts you picked?
* What did you learn about how Twitter operates from signing on?
* Pick a theme we've already discussed in this course (example: resistance) and consider: How does Twitter compare to Tumblr?
