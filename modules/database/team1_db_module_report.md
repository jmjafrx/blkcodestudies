A lot of the violence in this slave ship manifest is the offhanded way that very important details are forced into margins existing columns or just denoted with quotes to indicate repetition. When a person has children with them the word “children” is marked in the name column and when several people from the same family share a last name, their kinship is denoted with a quotation mark. We disrupted the CSV by adding an entire column called “Associated_with_children” to indicate whether or not person had children with them on the ship to make that fact more than an afterthought. We also explicitly wrote out all of the last names that were provided. This was significant because there were several members of the Singleton family that are being sent down to New Orleans to be sold as slaves, and seeing so many people in the same family forces the reader to realize that these people will ultimately be separated forever. 

In our first field we really wanted to emphasize individuals, we considered changing the name of the field to Cargo or Identification but we shied away from either for the exact opposite reason that slave owners imposed their own last name on their properties: because we cared about their humanity and self-identification. We also wrote out every last name that was merely reduced to a quotation mark in, again, an attempt to emphasize humanity. Our next field was in Boolean notation, yes if the were female and no if they were male. As we have seen in many documents and present-day interpretations, black women have been subjected to not only dehumanization and fetishization, but also erasure, something that we wanted to flip around this time around. The next field was in array notation for the complexions of the people, however instead of using complexion we used the term hue. Our final field was added after some introspection, that being whether the person was associated with children or not in Boolean notation. We added this field because even though there was a lot of people who were under the age of 10, not all of them were associated with adults and only some adults were associated with children.  

Our “corruption” primarily relied on extracting and emphasizing non-phenotypic characteristics, and combating gender stereotypes. One example is “Associated_with_children”. The creator of the original document crudely noted whether an individual had or was accompanied by a child. However, they did not find this category important enough for a column of its own. Though we do not know which children accompanied these adults, acknowledging these relationships with the Boolean notation emphasizes their significance. Additionally, we included the category “Is_Female”, for which we used a Boolean notation. Making “being female” positive (associated with ‘Y’) is a simple, but impactful way to turn the wrongfully implied bias (that “being female” is a negative, or a caveat to a human being’s value) on its head.

To be succinct, each record was given time and attention. After going through each person and trying to discern what exactly the information was saying on our own, we reconvened as a group to go through each record to ensure that we all agreed on what the name should be, whether a child should be associated with the person.
