## Team 3 Response: Aaron, Ellie, Helen, and Monica 

The CSV our team derived from the Slave Ship Manifest disrupts and corrupts the violence that is rooted in what this data represents. We changed the category label “name” to “given name,” highlighting that the names given to slaves were rarely given through familial lineage, but instead assigned by slaveowners. We also organized them by age, and showed how many of the slaves were black versus other complexions. We also included the complexions of the slaves to show how predominately black these groups were. Our team decided to focus on the ages most closely to emphasize the number of young children who endured these journeys, especially children who may have been separated from their families. 

We thought that changing the complexion column to “Is_Black?” using the Boolean approach disrupts the original documented data when looking at Plat’s and each individual’s appearance in the document that highlights the varieties in age and race. By changing the ‘Complexion’ column within the manifest to a Boolean formula, we more distinctly identify that some slaves aboard the ship were considered non-black. In doing this, we change the perceived racial paradigm of the domestic slave trade from white vs. black to white vs. a range of colors. As colorism was also embedded within the slave purchasing practice (lighter complexions were purchased at a higher price, typically for house work), by making Black the ‘Yes’ response in the Boolean formula, we reverse the negative connotations of colorism and a attribute a positive perspective on black bodies.
