## 2 Tumblr:
**What is being discussed?** 
* Colorism- prevalence of light skin women at the forefront of the show
* Queerness- the show needs to include stories of queer slaves from the time period. 
* Chris Meloni - at Underground premieres (but no commentary on his character in the show)
**What kind of information is being Tumbled? By whom? How do you know?**
* Most of the posts are GIFs of the episodes, show posters, spoilers, and comments encouraging people to watch the show. These posts are mostly fans of the shows. There is one handle called “underground-daily” that seems to be a Tumblr dedicated to making and promoting posts about the show.
**Who is participating in the discussion? Filmmakers? Actors? Historians? Students? What race, age, occupation? Are you sure? And how do you know?**
* The posters are mainly just viewers and fans of the show. I’m assuming most of the posters are African American and at least of high school age, due to the nature of the show
In addition:
**Who managed social media for UndergroundWGN? For 12 Years a Slave?**
* Unable to find the social media managers for either film.
* There is a three year gap between the production of the film and the TV show. Is there anything different about the social media for #12YearsASlave and #UndergroundWGN as a result?
* 12 Years a Slave only has a UK twitter that was last active 2 years ago. The last tweets congratulate Lupita on her new role in Star Wars, and press for people to watch the ‘Oscar Winning’ movie. It would make sense for the twitter to be inactive considering that the movie is out of the theatres, has won multiple awards, and is almost 4 years old
* Underground has an instagram page; 12 Years a Slave does not. This makes sense because Underground is an on-going series that needs constant promotion, whereas 12 Years a Slave does not.
* It appears Underground has more gifs on tumblr but that might be a result of being more accessible; tv vs film. Also might be because Underground is more recent, as is the availability of making gifs and using social media in  general.
## 3 Reflection:
**In at least 750 words, report back on the work you just completed - Use Fields and the other readings as a resource:**
1. Tumblr has a few users calling for queer characters in the show. Sexual orientation, like race, is an ideology for understanding the characteristics of other people. #12yearsaslave makes no mention of queerness, but #UndergroundWGN seems to have a strong following in the queer community. The show apparently goes on to show more than a few sex scenes, which may contribute to an overall sexual narrative that has left the door open to queer characters in the future. This shows that users and viewers hope that the show will be more representative of all identities. This is despite the fact that queer narratives may not have been as prevalent in reality and in recorded history during the pre-Antebellum period.
Tumblr users also criticize the choice of featuring a light skinned woman as one of the main characters in a period piece about slavery. In the status quo, discussions on colorism are prevalent in both traditional and social media, especially regarding the mistreatment of dark skin actresses. The discussion of colorism in #UndergroundWGN relates to Fields definition of ideology because it shows how individuals in the digital age are using their understanding of nuances within skin color and applying that to the show. 
To cope with the brutality of their existence, slaves used Christian spirituals as a forum to both vocalizing their pain and also to express their hope for a less damning future. In both 12 Years a Slave and Underground, we witness how the characters use spirituals as a source of uplifting them from undesirable conditions. In Underground, the Macon slaves shout hymns in their sorrow over the drowing of the slave baby. In 12 Years a Slave, Solomon sings Roll Jordan Roll to find strength to survive. The back and forth from the funeral to the daughter’s birthday party exemplifies how the lives of blacks and whites were in stark contrast at all times. The portrayal of the slaves surviving in such despondent settings while their masters live in bliss.
The behaviors of the slaves on the plantations are “coded” in that they have to follow certain guidelines of obedience and mannerisms in order to live life peacefully. For example, Ernestine, knows what she can do and say around the Master’s wife, the master himself, and to other slaves. This type of demeanor is how Ernestine has been able to live as harmonious as possible.
2. One digital resonance in Underground would be Elizabeth Hawkes. Today we’re very aware about mental illness and the signs that lead us to believe someone has a mental illness. We noticed that she seemed unstable because of her flashbacks and violent outbursts as a result of her inability to conceive a baby. These could be signs of depression as a result of this tragedy. However, during the antebellum era, this type of behavior could have been viewed as normal or be simply ignored.
When it comes to accents, we can hear a discrepancy between the North and South. The Northern accent is similar to how we speak today, which stands in stark contrast to the Southern accent that sounds more pronounced. However, the Southern accent isn’t as “proper” as it was in 12 Years a Slave. They spoke more casually and with more ‘slang’. 
Digital resonance was prevalent when talking about music. In parts of the show, there are songs that are popular in today’s time but were not necessarily the genre or style of music that was popular or even possible back in 1857. Black Skinned Head fit well into the opening scene; Noah breathing to the beat of the song was phenomenal, which was a well done move on the director’s part. Music during the party/funeral scene was not well placed, which might have been the intention. Juxtaposing the absurdity of the white gentry living lavishly while having a grand time as is an immense tragedy had not just occurred just a few feet from their doorstep with the grieving slave community hits home how different life was, and how cruel humanity could be. It would have been more poignant to hear the spiritual mourning tune rather than a modern song; the power of the scene felt lost as it is.
Interestingly, the candles on the birthday cake were just like today’s candles.
3. We have reached a moment in American racial dialogue where a critical mass of conversation and resources exist to do justice to the history of slavery. The digital moment allows us to have the conversation about this particular part of history with a fluency and level of detail that was previously impossible. The salience in the context of the digital moment is best seen in tech-heavy retellings. 12 Years a Slave is a good example of a big-budget, high production value slave narrative. As Lonnie Bunch described in his article in the Smithsonian Magazine, America had periods of when it was ready to understand and confront the history and realities of what happened during slavery. This digital moment, in which more and more films reveal the unspoken tragedies of slavery, demonstrates how America, at this time, is ready and open to discussing the topic. In addition, the Smithsonian African American History Museum also relies heavily on digital recreations of historical events. The result is that the history of slavery is more accessible and immersive in the digital moment. Consequently, the recreated narratives are all the more harrowing.
