**Plot**

The Television show, _Underground_, follows multiple story lines, involving field slaves, abolitionists, house slaves, and slave traders, plantation owners and more. These interactions not only provide us with insight in the brutal realities of the era, but allow the audience to witness the complex dynamics between individuals and groups of different backgrounds, races, and beliefs. 

_Part 1_

The first episode begins with an action packed chase. Noah, a black man working on a plantation in a Georgia plantation, runs from vicious slave catchers armed with guns and dogs. After his capture, Noah is sent to a small holding room with a handful of other slaves, disheartened by the fragile state of the men around him and the possible futility of their escape. The 5 candles behind him appear to be the main source of light in the room. Noah and an unnamed slave speak, discussing how they got to the cell. The slave reveals an injury which prevented him from crossing the Ohio River to safety, but nonetheless, claims that he had “mapped freedom.” At first, Noah is skeptical, but his hopes are reignited upon discovering potential instructions for a path to freedom carved into the wall, just as the slave said. Using his own blood and a dirtied cloth, creating a press of sorts of the instructions for freedom. When he returns to the plantation, after receiving five lashes for each dollar the Mr. Macon paid to buy him back, Noah shares his findings with Henry and begins contemplate who else he could trust. 

We first meet the abolitionist John Hawks on the steps of the courthouse, asserting that Dred Scott, a black man being prosecuted for running away, should receive proper representation in court. In spite of the northern location, virtually all individuals within earshot of Hawks ignored his speech, alluding an unspoken tension between mainstream northern culture in the 1850s and abolitionist rhetoric many illustrations of slavery fail to acknowledge. Various other complications arise in his life, from his wife, Elizabeth, being unable to bear children and a request for his house to be apart of the Underground Railroad.

Additionally, there are the house slaves who are nearly all of lighter complexion, and mostly women. Although they are not regularly exposed to the grueling conditions and treatment field slaves receive, they are not safe from the wrath of the plantation owner, Tom Macon and his wife Suzanna. Furthermore, working in the master’s house requires the utmost self-control and composure, Interactions with the field slaves are limited, although some, like Rosalee, get along with field slaves, having delivered a child for one, and shared kind words with another. After Noah’s scene in the jailhouse, 

We also meet August Pullman. Having met a young woman running away from slave traders, he begins to instruct her which direction to head next, warning her that the traders were close by. However, as the traders approach sooner than he had hoped, he hides her in his wagon. After throwing a knife into one man’s hand, and threatening another with his gun, August Pullman escapes unharmed. He appears to be a family man as well, sending money for his ailing wife at the Boston Hospital, and quick note, stating that his son and himself wish her well. 

_Part 2_

After Noah’s scene in the jailhouse, the episode cuts to Rosalee wiping down a dish, in solitude, in her house-slave uniform. Another house slave comes into the room and curtly tells her a list of tasks Rosalee must complete, as she walks away Rosalee sighs with sadness. The episode cuts to Rosalee holding her younger brother’s hand as they walk, silently, outside the quarters where the field slaves presumably live. He rips his hand from hers in a way that shows his disdain for her being a house slave. This disliking is shared by many other field slaves, as she walks towards Pearly Mae, an older woman, and her child, Pearly Mae’s husband, Moses, calls her and their daughter inside as he looks at Rosalee with distaste.

The scene then cuts to Rosalee’s younger brother, James, running inside to his older half-brother Sam carving a what appears to be a wooden horse. James then makes a suggestion of bringing it to the Macon’s main house to show his white friend, the son of Tom Macon, and Sam is completely averse to the idea, claiming that James will not have the toy unless it stays in his own house. Rosalee enters the room and remarks that the toy is better than any toy that the white child owns anyways, she adds that their mother, Ernestine, sent some food over to them. The fire in the room cackles as Sam claims he is not a dog and does not intend on eating scraps. Slave catchers rush past their open window on horses and begin attacking Henry, a slave who may know the whereabouts of Noah who has been missing for too long. 

B-roll of the exterior of the slave house is shown and Rosalee eventually walks out of her older half-brother’s home. She encounters Serafina, the women who she was the midwife to at the beginning of the episode, crying and babbling. She asks Serafina what the problem is and she replies that she “set him free.” Quickly realizing what she means by this, Rosalee runs back to Serafina’s home, she slips in the blood that left Serafina’s womb not very long before this moment and runs to the bathtub to find Serafina’s newborn baby dead in the water. She holds the child and wails in pain as the scene fades to black. 

The next scene begins with bird’s-eye view of a stagecoach entering from the right side of the screen in bright, day-light. The wagon section of the carriage holds the Noah, we then see it pass under a gate that has MACON in all white letters with Noah’s unnerved eyes also in the frame. From here it switches to Rosalee in the kitchen, alone again, stirring something absent-mindedly, clearly still shaken by the findings of the previous night. Her mother then enters the room and demands that her head return to the task at hand, as opposed to being stuck in last night. They have a conversation about struggles and fears of giving birth to children on a plantation, Ernestine being honest about her own fears as she realized she was pregnant with Rosalee and Sam. Ernestine then exits the room, again, reminding Rosalee of their easily excitable masters. 
We then cut to a bird’s-eye view of wagon entering an empty field with what appears to be a safe house and August Pullman, the man who played white savior for the woman who was trying to escape. As he tells her it’s safe to exit the wagon, she begins to ask him why he decided to help her. His response claims that he wants the world his son is going to live in to be more fair than the world that they currently live in. 

The scene cuts again to Rosalee entering the shed that Noah sits in, waiting for her aid. As she enters the room, Noah feebly arises and is still, clearly, playing up the hurt negro trope that he has adopted. As he takes off his shirt he pretends to be too weak to completely remove it on his own, so he weakly asks for her assistance. After this he begins to make conversation by mentioning that he knows Sam, Rosalee’s field-salve brother, but how he has never met with her. He further elaborates on the fact that it must be comfortable to sleep in such big, nice beds that must be provided to the house-slaves. As he is discussing this, she is dabbing his back and upper arms lightly with alcohol, but after a time she visibly gets tired of hearing the same narrative that she most likely hears from every field-slave and defends herself by claiming that she’s still a slave, no matter where she sleeps, and ends up pouring a large portion of the alcohol on his back. After this she rolls up his pant leg to inspect the apparent wound that he must have that is creating the limp that he apparently has and finds nothing. At this moment is when Noah stops playing a victim’s role and takes on almost a persona of pride and egotism, as he was able to fool the house slave. When she asks him why he pretends, his response is brief: everyone pretends. He then thanks her for having formally met her and leaves the shed, taking his shirt from her hands and beginning the act of dumb, handicapped, negro. 

After this scene, we cut to John and Elizabeth Hawkes having sex on a train. Right as though it seems they’re both about to climax, Elizabeth interrupts the moment by mentioning a sex tip her friends had mentioned to her. The sex diffuses, something that seems to be a common occurrence by John’s lack of surprise when she takes away from the moment, and he rolls over to face her and have conversation. He mentions his encounter with William Still outside of the Dred Scott court case. While he explains that he said no to William’s proposition of housing runaway slaves, he also turns the idea into a question to explore Elizabeth’s reception. She immediately reels from the thought and mentions all the risks that they would be taking in housing slaves, and the fact that they need to focus on their own family first. To this John replies, “What family?” and realizes his mistake just as quickly as Elizabeth gets up and leaves. 

After this scene, we come back to Noah, except this time he is finally in his own home and not being brutalized or chased. He reunites with his friend Henry, who is doing push ups and explains his delay and his “limp.” He then goes on to tell Henry about his discovery of the map to freedom and proposes the idea of assembling a team of people to help assist them to reaching freedom and Henry jumps on the idea instantly. During this scene rock music plays in the background.

The scene switches again to the porch of the Macon’s house with Tom, Suzanna, their daughter, Ernestine, and Rosalee. Ernestine is finishing up the final touches on the Macon daughter’s hair for her party that she’ll be having later that night. As she concludes, the daughter jumps up in delight and explains her gratitude to “Stine” for completing it and her dress. Suzanna notices this joy and immediately finds the need to remind Ernestine of her place among the family. She recommends to her husband that James, Ernestine’s son, begin to start working in the field so that they are able to sell him off. Tom appears uninterested and Suzanna knows this, but Ernestine and Rosalee certainly understand the message that Suzanna is sending with such a suggestion: you may be at the table, but it’s only at my will. 

The scene cuts to Noah and Henry hanging up decorations for the party in the woods and they are discussing the possible candidates for their escape plan. During this scene a sort of blues rhythm is playing in the background, creating a sense of excitement. The music fades when Cato enters the conversation and asks Noah about how his leg is doing. He threatens that once a group of people find the wagon that would show where Noah abandoned it, he’s essentially a goner, however Noah brushes this off. Cato does not back down, and he lets Noah know that he sees through his victim act. As Noah tries to walk away from the conversation, Cato keeps nagging at him and gets the reaction he wants. I didn’t notice this the first time, but when Noah swivels around and comes back at Cato, he momentarily loses his limp, causing Cato to smile because his suspicions were confirmed. 

We go back to August, presumably in his home, where a black man tells him that one of his horses must be put down. His son watches his father approach the stable with a loaded gun and asks in a frightened tone what he plans to do, August pulls out and baseball and mitt and effectively avoids the sad conversation that would have had to ensue. 

In the next scene a prime example of Suzanna’s contempt for not only slaves, but particularly James and his mother is shown when Bill is driving a wagon and James and Suzanna’s son get in the way, causing the items in the wagon to spill out. He becomes infuriated and begins to approach the boys. While Suzanna asks Rosalee to remove her own son from the situation, even with Ernestine’s request to personally remove both boys from the situation, Suzanna refuses. Rosalee watches as her younger brother stands and nearly gets whipped by this man, but she decides to intervene and take the punishment herself, Noah watches this from a distance, obviously impressed with the house slave. 

_Part 3_

Towards last third of the show we discover that John and Elizabeth Hawkes were on their way to the Macon plantation to see his brother, Tom Macon, and attend Tom’s daughter’s birthday party. The very next scene shows all of the field slaves and Cato singing a spiritual called I Got Shoes (Walk all over God’s Heaven) at a funeral for the baby that was drowned by his mother earlier in the episode. This scene is splice with scenes of the white partygoers having a good time dancing and drinking the night away. 

As the slaves are burying the baby Noah asks the preacher to read his map for him because he suspects that the preacher must be reading the bible he carries in his pocket and Cato sees this conversation from a distance and becomes very suspicious of Noah. 

Meanwhile, Mr. Macon asks John Hawkes to become his campaign manager in his run for senator. We also see Rosalee outside paying her respects to the baby when Noah finds her there and they discuss what it means to be free.

Then we cut to a scene of Elizabeth sitting alone in the parlor when Mrs. Macon and female friends of hers begin to talk to Elizabeth and insult her inability to conceive after she expresses her distaste for their use of slaves. Once Mrs. Macon and her friends leave the camera pans up to show that Rosalee’s little brother has been sitting in a box hanging from the ceiling fanning Elizabeth the whole time and Elizabeth is clearly bothered by it.

After the party John Hawkes tells Elizabeth that he’s going to take the position in the name of putting their family first but she stops him and says that they need to do their part in aiding the Underground Railroad. The next thing find out is that August Pullman is actually a slave catcher and seems to be using the money he makes from tricking slaves to take care of his family. The next scene shows the preacher bringing the map to his wife, who can actually read, and she sings the song of freedom that’s written in blood on the cloth. As she sings we see a montage of Noah’s crew preparing for escape.

Later that night Noah is called to the Big House and Cato threatens to reveal his knowledge about the lost cart and expose Noah if Noah didn’t bring him along in their escape. The episode ends with Noah contemplating whether or not he should allow Cato to come along as they stand in front of Mr. Macon’s desk.


**Music**

During the funeral/party scene as the visual keeps switching between showing each event so does the music that goes with each scene. The funeral is accompanied by a somber spiritual called I Got Shoes (Walk All Over God's Heaven) sung by the cast while the party had Paranavigar raging in the background, taking the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster ranging from deep sadness to an energetic high, emphasizing the pain and suffering that serves as the foundation for the white people’s fun and comfort. 

The episode begins and ends with Kanye West’s “Black Skinhead” which is a song about taking pride in your blackness to extreme levels and the song seems to coincide with Noah trying to live his life and free himself from bondage, which would have seemed pretty extreme back then.

In the interview linked [here](https://youtu.be/cNn8G6vqGxs?t=374) a couple actresses from the show say that the mix of present day and historical music is meant to throw people off so they don’t know what to expect but also to let people of today know exactly what is happening because they can understand what the songs mean.

**Plot and Character Observations**

We are definitely meant to empathize with the field slaves and with Rosalee and her immediate family. We are also supposed to empathize with John Hawkes and his wife. Those are pretty clear-cut. August Pullman and Cato, however, are a little more gray. They both do awful things but the narrative gives them sympathetic motivations for doing what they do. 

We are clearly meant to hate the Macon family though, they are portrayed as the epitome of southern white aristocracy and behave in reprehensible ways.

### Research 

Executive Producers, Directors and Creators

Multiple producers were involved in creating Underground. Akiva Goldsman, for instance, winner of a 2002 Oscar for his writing in _A Beautiful Mind_ and producer for various films of the _Transformers_ saga, helped produce all episodes of _Underground_ so far. There are also many black producers including but not limited to:
* Misha Green, a female black executive producer and co-creator of Underground (Joe Pokaski is the other co-creator) and writer of top shows like _Sons of Anarchy_<sup>1</sup>
* Anthony Hemingway, director and executive producer of _Underground_ and director of episodes of _The Wire_, _Orange is the New Black_, and the movie _Red Tails_<sup>2</sup>
* Mike Jackson, producer of _Southside with You_<sup>3</sup>
* Ty Stiklorius, who is producing _Monster_, to be released in 2017, based on the book by Walter Dean Myers about the incarceration of a black teen in New York juvenile detention.<sup>4</sup>
* John Legend, perhaps the most recognizable name amongst the _Underground_ producers, is equally as influential in the show’s produce. The opening song to the series, Kanye West’s “Black Skinhead”, is probably testament to this.<sup>5</sup>

The high caliber of producers and writers, in addition to the invaluable experience of many crew members in African American films reflect allow for a dramatic, well constructed snapshot of 1850s America and the raw, unedited struggles of slaves. 

**Tumblr**

UndergroundWGN: Although a small handful of posts were under this tag, there was a variety in post content. One post contained multiple dramatic gifs in response to the season finale, while many others were fruitless gifs and pictures of August Pullman, played by Chris Meloni. Three posts mentioned adding an LGBTQ+ dimension to the series, stating that “african american queer people’s histories” were often disregarded, and another calling for a petition for a LGBTQ+ character on the show. The posts were written by independent tumblr accounts. 

Hurricane Katrina tags were not found, however, there were multiple interviews posted. The video “Jawn Murray Interviews Amirah Vann & Adina Porter About WGN's ‘Underground’” was particularly interesting. Both women were asked multiple questions, including which characters they connected with (excluding their own) and whether or not they were able to “emotionally disconnect” from the story while on set. 

As for other tags, most were simply variations of #UndergroundWGN, although there were more mentions of the characters’ names on these tags than in the #12YearsASlave tags.

### Report

**Barbara Fields**

In _Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life_, Barbara Fields asserts that ideology is the "vocabulary of day-to-day existence, through which people make rough sense of the social reality that they live and create from day to day." Fields states that an ideology is not something that can simply be passed down like shoes or socks, however, ideologies can have legacies and are not as removed from each other as some may think.

In the [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNn8G6vqGxs) with Amirah Vann and Adina Porter, Jawn Murray asks why Underground is not “just another” slave show. Vann notes that the African Americans are taught to be “ashamed” of their history. The legacy of this “wash” and rhetoric has affected the means we use to communicate and has often incorrectly labeled our social reality as one of an inconsequential couple of centuries, and consequently, changed the ideology revolving around black men, women, and children in America. 
If one were to look at this situation in a coding context, one could say that the machine that “translates” the letter on the screen, the code that allows Americans to process the events and meaning behind Underground, skews the image and changes the way we understand the content. Perhaps this is also reflected by the apparent absence {is ABSENCE the right term?} of posts on the #12YearsASlave or #UndergroundWGN tags about being proud to be black because of their ancestors’ struggles. 


**Digital Resonances**

In 12 Years a Slave I think that one good example of digital resonance would be the moment when Solomon comes back to his family at the very end. The act of reunions are almost entirely digital nowadays. The existence of the website ancestry.com is a prime example of that. The ability to communicate across continents with applications such as Facebook, GroupMe, and WhatsApp all serve as digital reunions. And clearly while not every reuniting of family members is as emotional, to say that none of these caliber incidents exist would be incorrect. With all the unrest happening in the Middle East, a Facebook check-in status can be just as relieving. In fact, this type of “check-in” is exactly what Solomon tried to do in every attempt to contact his family. So not only does this resonance apply to the coming home scene, but it was present all throughout the movie in unique instances.

In UndergroundWGN, an instance of digital resonance is found in the first couple of scenes where John Hawkes is introduced. He is shown literally dragging his podium up the steps of the courthouse and preaching to a people that are not at all interested in anything he has to say on the Dred Scott case before them. However he is able to grab the attention of one man, an abolitionist that actively helped escaped slaves live in the north after their previous life. This type of selective hearing, only being able to reach out to those who don’t necessarily need reaching out to is seen most frequently, in our opinion, on Twitter. With minimal difficulty, “following” those who are similar to us and “muting” or “blocking” those who have opinions that we disagree with, makes tailoring the world to our own explicit view is nothing unheard of. In Underground, those people who did not even attempt to listen to John were the example of a “block” or “mute,” and the seeking out of him by William Still was an example of a “follow” in addition to “Turning tweet notifications on.” Do I necessarily think it’s a bad thing that we, as humans, tend to do this? No. However I do think that in this time, no one can afford to completely silence another person without shutting off a whole lifetime of experiences.


**Salience of the past in this digital moment**

The history of slavery is essential to this digital moment. This show’s entire premise is based on the accounts and details recovered from research into the United States in the antebellum period, 6 years before the emancipation of the slaves. The co-creators themselves said in an interview that everyone character was based on stories they found in real narratives stored in archives. This show’s entire purpose is to transport the audience back to a painful time in our history and give some agency and humanity to the slaves that have very much been reduced to objects for us to pity. Making us as viewers actively root for the slaves and follow them as they make the emotional and physical journey to freedom gives us a window into the kinds of decisions people had to make and the strength and bravery required to survive and escape such brutal and horrific conditions. 

Watching this show forces us to come to terms with the fact that real actual people with lives and hopes and fears were being treated worse than animals for a very long time. This show is also salient in the sense that it tells us that even today when we see or experience extreme violence and injustice, complacency will get us nowhere. We also see that ending oppression is a group effort and being an ally means nothing if you are not willing to use your privileges to help as much as you can.
