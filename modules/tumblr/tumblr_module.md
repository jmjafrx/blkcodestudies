#Tumblr Module

##TEAMWORK: Due by 4:15 pm, February 16, 2017 

**February 16, 2017 - working presentations IN CLASS**
**Individual Analysis due February 16, 2017, by midnight - by email: jmj@jhu.edu**

By now you have seen the film 12 Years a Slave (2013) and the first episode of the TV series *Underground*. You've read about ideology, truancy, Gor√©e Island, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and the Code Noir. You've grown and will continue to grow familiar with Tumblr as a platform. You are also learning to decipher and build a vocabulary around what "Black Code Studies" is and does. Words like archive, history, memory, blackness, resistance, insurgents, and fugitivity should be part of your lexicon along with words like dashboard, hashtag, git, pull, markdown, and media.  

**Your assignment:**

Build a Black Code Studies Tumblr Universe using the following texts:
* 12 Years a Slave, the original narrative
* The Louisiana Code Noir (available in the documents folder)
* 12 Years a Slave, the film
* Underground WGN, episode 1
* Any and all of the readings thus far
* Anything you research and find on your own (verified primary and secondary sources only)
		
##Guidelines

* Each Team may create only ONE Tumblr
* Each Team Tumblr must have at least but no more than FIVE original posts
* Each Team Tumblr may reblog from another Team Tumblr an unlimited number of times
* Each Team Tumblr must integrate into the Black Code Studies Tumblr as follows:
	* There are five blank TEXT posts at the front of the Black Code Studies Tumblr. Each Team will be assigned ONE of those posts. You will use it as an INDEX for your Tumblr. You may do anything with the INDEX you want, but it must include at least one link to Team's BCS Tumblr
	
##Rubric - 

If Black Fugitivity is/was a tumblr...

 - A collection of how, in the present day, black fugtivity could be escaping the prison system and its after effects due to continued criminalization of the black body
- Stories of free blacks defying stereotypes of success/education/economic mobility/political power
 - Black artistic expression
- acknowledges the lies and analyzes them with truths
- Images of black people in all settings, free, enslaved, etc.
- images of the breaking of chains
- Images of the happiest black free people of the time. It would include reblogs of DIY's on the best ways of surviving when running away. IT would have links to ways of communicating with free blacks creating a network of non-compliance.
- Quotes from black people with firsthand experience running away or helping others run away
- Stories of black underground railroad conductors
- Images of places runaway slaves would hide 
- Stories about winning court cases against officers who kill black individuals, with appropriate punishment
- Parallels of slave catching and police violence in the african american community today through photos and written accounts
- Reblogs present day examples of Black Fugitivity 
- Not displayed in a grid-like template 
- Varied media (like in our archive box: photos, political cartoons, diary entries, oral history, letters, images like Gordon and Wilson) 
- Photos of free black neighborhoods in free/slave states (States with free populations but also slaves)
- audio of runaways getting chased by hounds
- Creative, not just a boring archive 
- A fluid setup, similar to prezi (if that's possible to do in tumblr)
- Displays Black fugitivity as a continuous movement and the poor representations of blackness as an ongoing problem 
- images of well dressed black men and women
- images of elite black social groups

##Individual Analysis

* How does the Tumblr your Team created represent/do/enact (verb is your choice) Black Code Studies (this should be the longest answer, at least 750 words)
* What process did your Team use to create the Tumblr? 
* How did you participate in that process?
* What roles and responsibilities did members of the Team have? How were they defined?
* Is there anything else you want to add about the assignment, the final product, or your work with the team?
