#Assignment #1 - #12YearsASlave

##Due on the [Black Code Studies Tumblr](http://blackcodestudies.tumblr.com) by 12 Noon on Feb 2, 2017

The film 12 Years a Slave (2013) is an adaptation of the 19th century slave narrative of the same name Twelve Years a Slave: Narrative of Solomon Northup, a Citizen of New-York, Kidnapped in Washington City in 1841, and Rescued in 1853. The film, produced by Brad Pitt's production company Plan B Entertainment, used social media in interesting ways. Along with introducing you to Tumblr, this assignment is designed to expose you to how social media worked and the impact of those trends on how historical narratives of slavery. You will then compare the trends you see with your experience viewing the film.

**YOU NEED TO SEE THE FILM *12 YEARS A SLAVE* TO DO THIS ASSIGNMENT!** 

##Film showing: February 1, 7pm, Shriver 5 (or view on your own)

##Steps

###1. Create a Tumblr account (skip to step #2 if you already have a Tumblr account you’d like to use):

Go to [http://tumblr.com](http://tumblr.com) and sign up:

![frontpage](https://github.com/blackcodestudies/blkcodestudies/blob/master/nontext/TumblrFrontPage.png)




Fill in the requested information, including a username of your choice (keep in mind that your username is a matter of public record and will be seen by everyone in the course; choose accordingly). You may want to choose a username you can recreate across multiple platforms (i.e. Twitter, Github).

You’ll be taken to your sign in page that will look something like this:

![tumblrdashboard](https://github.com/blackcodestudies/blkcodestudies/blob/master/nontext/TumblrEntryPNG.png)


This is your “dashboard.” This is where you will post your work. You have several options: text, photos (any kind of image file), quotes, links, chats (think screenwriting), audio (any kind of audio file), and video (by uploading or embedding). Feel free to play around here for a bit, get comfortable.

Information you post here will post to your personal Tumblr (or Tumblog). You are welcome to customize it in any way you wish or not--**using your personal Tumblr will not be needed for this course.** This is your personal space--do with it what you will.


###2. Confirm that you have signed up for Tumblr and post your username in the #admin channel on [Slack](https://blackcodestudies.slack.com/messages/admin/details/). This allows me to add you to blkcodestudies.tumblr.com.

You’re encouraged to follow your classmates as well. 

Everything you post for credit MUST BE POSTED TO THE Black Code Studies Tumblr and not your personal Tumblr. Make sure you check the URL (blackcodestudies.tumblr.com) after you’ve posted to be sure it is up and LIVE (i.e. anyone can read it or see it posted on the site). If you have questions about how to do this or what this means, contact me before your first post is due. 


###3. Get connected. 

While still signed in, point your browser to the http://blkcodestudies.tumblr.com.

In the upper right hand corner you’ll see a “Follow” button. Click it.

![TumblrFollowClick](https://github.com/blackcodestudies/blkcodestudies/blob/master/nontext/TumblrFollowClick.png)

You are now following the Black Code Studies Tumblr. It is empty. You get to fill/create it. 


###4. SEARCH. Go back to your Tumblr dashboard. In the upper right hand corner is a search box. Search through posts tagged #12YearsASlave or #SolomonNorthrup. 

Make note of ---

* What is being discussed? 
* What kind of information is being Tumbled? By whom? How do you know? 
* Who is participating in the discussion? Filmmakers? Actors? Historians? Students? What race, age, occupation? Are you sure? And how do you know?  
* Follow the links being posted--What is being posted? What are they about? Are there trends that you can distinguish across tweets, links or who is being retweeted? Does anything--comments, information, images, video, news, links, people-appear to be tagged more often than others? Is there anything especially absent from the discussion?
* Are there other hashtags beyond the three suggested that seem to have more or less information about Hurricane Katrina? How many other tags can you find?
* How do posts change over time--when you checked the hashtag on Tuesday night, are there different posts when you check on Wednesday afternoon?

###5. If you haven't yet--Watch the film *12 Years a Slave*

###6. Report

In at least 500 words, write a Tumblr post summarizing your findings:
* What did you find most interesting about the “#12YearsASlave” tag over time? 
* How would you categorize and organize the tweets (and the corresponding links) you collected? 
* How would you summarize your findings? 
* Did you learn anything new--and about what? 
* What would a stranger know about slavery or black history based on what you saw? 
* What would a stranger miss if they based their understanding of Solomon Northrup and slavery solely on the “12YearsaSlave” tag? 
* What are you missing--not having seen the film or read the narrative?


These questions are just guides. Feel free to choose only one (or make up your own) when writing your response. Add links, image, any text or non-text material you like to format your post. 

*You are strongly encouraged to write your post in [Markdown](http://bit.ly/2kMpyU7) as practice for what is to come but that is not required for this post.*
