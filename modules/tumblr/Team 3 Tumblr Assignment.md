# Underground Ep 1: Annotations
## Scene-By-Scene Analysis

Black man running through the woods

- "Black Skinheads" by Kanye -- creates suspense
- Very strong opening and definitely purposeful with song choice (music by John Legend)
- **Runaway slave** vs. White man and dog
- Failed escape attempt - very last second

Opening Sequence

 - Beautiful scenery of the South, somewhat eerie considering we know what happens here - brutal cruelty
 - Supplemented with spiritual singing background music
 - Field slaves vs. House slaves - picking cotton vs. tending to garden - difference in attire, appearance, work environment, etc.

More running, but for different reason (to deliver baby)

- Character: **Rosalee**, house slave, and **Rosalee's mother**
- Running again underscored with beating drums, similar to Black Skinheads
- Miracle of new life contrasted with always having to worry about slaveowner - "Miss Susannah gonna throw a fit"

**John Hawkes**

- Introduction of first white figure sympathetic to slaves
- Speaking to no one, at a heavy podium with no audience
- Equating runaway slaves to other American religiously persecuted (i.e. Puritans)
- Rock music, then silence. As no one is listening.

Post office scene

- Introduction of second white character, shown in sympathetic light - **Pullman**
- Poorer white, most likely non-slaveowner, who definitely does not live on a house like the one we saw before

Caught runaway slaves chained up by bounty hunters

- Most likely slave we saw at the beginning of the episode
- Contraption around the neck, chains, very heavy imagery of being captive
- Reference of female slave as "bitch", as if animal

Slaves in the house

- Well-dressed, very conscious of manners, young black boy eating in kitchen
- Rosalee's mother - very obedient, knows what to do

Rich white family 

- Father of house running for senate - vying for power and status
- "As if the slaves can do anything without my constant instruction" - obviously much more going on behind the scenes that white woman doesn't know about

Mr. Hawkes and **Mr. Still**

- Still - obviously free African-American, well-dressed
- Helps runaways - asking Hawkes to house runaway slaves
- Hawks hesitant - possibly afraid of what he has to lose?

Pullman helping escaped slave

- Seems to be very well-versed on how to help slaves escape - route, marking scent on tree/into river
- Violence against other bounty hunters - abolitionist?
- Caught runaway watching Pullman
- Rap music as background - excitement

John Hawkes home + wife

- **Elizabeth Hawkes** - depressed about infertility, shown destroying the house with a hammer
- Still acting as if she will have a baby 
- Both abolitionists, or at least against slavery

Escaped slaves

- Angle from eyes of escaped slave #1 - defeated, sick, hurt slaves
- Scene of absolute hopelessness
- Hope brought by other escaped slave who has the "map to freedom"
- Written out, uses own blood to etch

Killing own child

- "Can't live like this, not like this" - mother kills newborn
- Imagery of blood causes panic - common motif of blood in scenes, but all evoke very different emotions

Rosalee and her mother

- Rosalee's mother explains fear for children as a slave - happiness of having a child is overshadowed by the fear they will be sold, beaten, overworked, "too purty" (most likely referring to rape)
- Reminds me of Beloved, how she was being a protective mother
- Shows that Rosalee's mother is very obedient to protect children

Return of **Noah (runaway slave)** 

- Slaveowner explaining how impossible it is to run away - take away hope
- Introduction of obedient, trusted Black - dressed well - "only takes one to spoil 'em all" - face scarred?
- Laughs at Noah's punishment of being whipped, immediately dislikable

Pullman and escaped female slave

- Abolitionist working toward improving future for son - likable and sympathetic character

Rosalee treating Noah's wounds

- Two slaves of two very different kinds - never spoken before, despite being two slaves on same plantation - very different living conditions
- "Still slaves, no matter where we sleep" - Rosalee
- "We all pretending in someway"

John and Elizabeth Hawkes on train

- Trying to have a child - unhappy sex as symbol of struggling relationship
- "It's a noble cause... but..." -- Elizabeth as a faux ally 
- "It's breaking the law" "Same law that allows people to own other people"

Noah shares the plan

- **Henry**, Rosalee's brother, obviously also wants to runaway to freedom

Plantation owner

- **Susannah's** jealousy towards Rosalee's mother? Because her own daughter obviously loves slave more
- Susannah: clearly a strong antagonist
- Threatening to send her son into the fields and sell him

Noah forming a team

- Choosing people with certain skills that are trustworthy
- **Cato** - the obedient slave - "You think you a free man"
- Uses the term "boy" to anger Noah - "big N-word", what does it mean?

Pullman and his son

- Kind father who wants to shelter and protect his son
- Friendly with his slave? Worker?

Rosalee getting whipped

- Obviously both children's fault, but only about to whip Rosalee's brother 
- Painful scene of Rosalee getting whipped - whites don't care at all - demonstrates her previous statement "still slaves, no matter where we sleep"

John Hawkes is slaveowner's (Tom) brother !!!

Funeral/Party Scene

- Party seems very modern, maybe because of music
- The obvious contrast between a tragic funeral for a child and an opulent, over-the-top birthday party for another child
- Cato also at funeral? So he is a part of the slave community??

Noah shares the plan with more people to create team

- Doubt, hesitation, among all - running away is impossible
- Father of dead baby - "all that awaits us here is death"

Elizabeth at party with Susannah

- Susannah says "All you northerners do is talk while we do all the work" when in reality she doesn't do any work, slaves do
- Shows clash between North and South in Antebellum times - Tom is a Northerner that enjoys a Southern lifestyle
- Shocking image of young boy fanning for the guests

Rosalee and Noah

- Inciting ideas of running away, being free

John and Elizabeth

- "This isn't the kind of world I want to bring children into, and we need to change that"
- Parallel to mother who killed newborn baby - "can't live like this"
- Common theme of ending slavery to make the world a better place for children to live

Pullman

- Actually a bounty hunter !!!!!!!!! ???
- Tricked female runaway to get a higher bounty - plot twist, shows Pullman is actually an antagonist

Noah's forced alliance with Cato

- Cato surprisingly also wants to be free - wants to be taken along with Noah
- Threatens to tell Tom about his escape attempt --- Noah forced into agreement


# Tumblr Research

Exploring through the Underground WGN Tumblr tag first and foremost definitely made me want to watch the rest of the season. Like the 12 Years A Slave tag, the most popular posts were predominantly visuals and graphics, but by depicting characters, their growth throughout the season, their relationships, their motivations, and etc., these posts helped me come to deeply learn the characters of the show and cause me to become invested in their narratives. There was also definitely a lot more ongoing discussion about the show, people's thoughts on it, people's favorite characters, their reactions to deaths/plot twists, etc. This is most likely because Underground WGN is a lot more recent than 12 Years A Slave (2016 v. 2013), but also the nature of a television show is often not to just tell one story, but dive into multiple stories that run together. 

**Audience Reaction**: There was a lot of praise about the show, people going as far to say this is one of the best slavery film/shows they've ever watched, or that nothing else on television competes. However, among those posts, there were also posts criticizing the lack of darker skin women in leading roles, people hoping to possibly see a queer character in the next season. Most of these posts seem to be by African-American women, judging by their other content, but the audience range seems to be wide, with men and women posting about the show. Most of those posting seem to be below age 30, but that is most of Tumblr's usership, so that makes sense.

**About Show Itself** (as posted on Tumblr): WGN America, the broadcast channel Underground is on, is also posted about, as Underground apparently pushed up their ratings by 1000 percent, and its success renewed it for a second season. One post notes that the show is produced by Sony TV and Tribune Studios, with executive producers Misha Green, Joe Pokaski, John Legend, Akiva Goldsman, Tory Tunnell, Joby Harold, Mike Jackson, Ty Stiklorius and Anthony Hemingway. There is also several posts about the show's music, with playlists being made, as well as people using quotes from the soundtrack and relating them to certain scenes.

**Other Media**: There are specific Tumblrs dedicated to Underground, including u/dailyunderground, that posts posts daily about the history of the underground railroad, promotional photos, photos of press events, etc. I was glad to see discussion about the history regarding the show, as it means the show has sparked renewed interest in the era.

**Digital Resonances**
-------
In **12 Years A Slave** there is a scene where Solomon walks into a shop and is greeted by the store clerk as "sir". The camera pans to a black man walking into the store and looking at Solomon and his family with a mix of confusion and amazement as he is seen decoding his own, as well as Solomon's, blackness by coming to the realization that Solomon is a free man. His master then comes into the store and scolds him only to notice Solomon interacting with the white store owner as equals. He too decodes what blackness is through the eyes of a man who only sees blackness as something to be bought and sold. The way that this scene is shot shows the digital resonance of decoding blackness in that day and age through the lens of a slave and a slave owner and the way we process the interaction through the movie screen.

**Underground WGN** opens with the song Black Skinhead by Kanye West, which sets a certain mood for the viewers, which is supposed to be synonymous to how certain characters feel. The digital resonance between the viewing and listening experience of the opening music and the content of the show is supposed to start off the experience with suspense and discomfort to align with the distressing subject matter.

## 2. Barbara Fields wrote: Ideology is the "vocabulary of day-to-day existence, through which people make rough sense of the social reality that they live and create from day to day." What links can you make between ideology, coding and slavery using #12YearsASlave and #UndergroundWGN?

Two ideological beliefs influence the narratives of 12 Years A Slave and Underground from within the narrative and from editorial decisions: religion and agency.
Religion a tightly held, but flexible ideology. It suits the needs of many, especially those on opposing sides. Men like Epps and Ford use biblical anecdotes to legitimize their rule over their slaves, while Solomon holds to religion, believing that through faith he might be able to rejoin his family. In Underground, Noah suggests that a benevolent God would not allow his people to be forced into such a condition, but later leverages the preacher’s own religious beliefs to coerce him into deciphering the code to find the way to freedom.
By setting up Underground as an escape thriller, the writers automatically imbue the main characters with a sense of agency and freedom of movement to accomplish their goals. Overseers are less attentive or perceptive to Noah’s plans. While Rosalee embodies some of the fears regarding the very real risks of leaving the plantation, most of the other slave characters easily hop on the bandwagon with little time to reflect on their decision. The format of the show accelerates the plot a considerable amount, making an escape plan seem comically easy.
In the case of 12 Years A Slave, however, Solomon displays agency in his engineering work on Ford’s plantation and multiple escape attempts, but is forced to reckon with the restrictions of his surroundings. Therefore, in multiple instances we see delicate, realistic shifts in power and agency between Solomon and his adversaries, which hold more true to his memoir.



## 3. What is the salience of the past (the history of slavery) in this digital moment?

In this digital moment more than ever, producers search for the latest inspiration to create the latest hit show that distinguishes itself from all others. In recent years particularly, writers have turned towards the past to revamp history in a new way that appeals to viewers like never before though new media platforms. This trend can be seen in both film and television series, with Selma, 12 Years a Slave, Lincoln, Django Unchained, Pope Francis, The People v. O.J. Simpson, Downtown Abbey, The Crown, and in this case specifically, Underground. The past has proven to make a comeback bigger than ever before, thanks to an unprecedented access to information made possible by the Internet and seamless communication across the world in a matter of seconds.
The salience of the history of slavery in this digital moment has proven particularly important as more studies and personal accounts of slavery have come to the surface, and the latest technologies have brought these personal experiences to life seeming and looking almost completely realistic and believable on the big screen. Additionally, in the increasingly diverse world we live in, it is important for writers and producers to take advantage of the salience of the past in order to understand how much we have developed historically from the times of slavery and the Civil Rights movement, but also how much room for improvement and acceptance remains. It is also important to realize how these stories of racism and dehumanizing treatment is not far from our realities, and to ascertain how relatable these characters are.
