#Assignment #2 - #12YearsASlave x #UndergroundWGN

##TEAMWORK: Due on Github by 12 Noon on Feb 2, 2017

By now you have seen the film 12 Years a Slave (2013). Like that film, the TV series Underground, which began airing on WGN in 2016, also uses social media in interesting ways. Unlike 12 Years a Slave, Underground is not based on an extant slave narrative. However, it is infused with actual historical events and characters. 

From IMDB:

>Underground centers on a group of slaves planning a daring 600-mile escape from a Georgia plantation. Along the way, they are aided by a secret abolitionist couple running a station on the Underground Railroad as they attempt to evade the people charged with bringing them back, dead or alive.

Your assignment: Each team is required to DECODE slavery on screen by comparing #12YearsASlave to #UndergroundWGN. 

**YOU NEED TO SEE THE FILM *the first episode of Underground WGN* TO DO THIS ASSIGNMENT!** 

##Film showing: February 6, 7pm, Shriver 5 (or view on your own)

##Steps

###1. View the first episode of Underground WGN

###2. Annotate the episode

* Who are the characters in the episode? 
* Figure out which characters appear in histories of slavery (there are a few) and identify who they are.
* Setting (time/place)
* Key events in the plot
* What kind of music plays? Which artists? Why would the producers choose them?
* What do you notice in the plot? What DON'T you notice?
* Who are we, the viewers, supposed to identify with, empathize with, dislike, etc....[insert your own noun]? Who is the intended audience?
* Who are the producers? Who created the show? Who is involved behind the scenes?

Scene by Scene, decode every element of Episode 1. 

###3. RESEARCH. Go back to your Tumblr dashboard. In the upper right hand corner is a search box. Search through posts tagged #UndergroundWGN just as you did with #12YearsASlave

Make note of ---

* What is being discussed? 
* What kind of information is being Tumbled? By whom? How do you know? 
* Who is participating in the discussion? Filmmakers? Actors? Historians? Students? What race, age, occupation? Are you sure? And how do you know?  
* Follow the links being posted--What is being posted? What are they about? Are there trends that you can distinguish across tweets, links or who is being retweeted? Does anything--comments, information, images, video, news, links, people-appear to be tagged more often than others? Is there anything especially absent from the discussion?
* Are there other hashtags beyond the three suggested that seem to have more or less information about Hurricane Katrina? How many other tags can you find?
* How do posts change over time--when you checked the hashtag on Tuesday night, are there different posts when you check on Wednesday afternoon?

In addition:

* Who managed social media for UndergroundWGN? For 12 Years a Slave? 
* There is a three year gap between the production of the film and the TV show. Is there anything different about the social media for #12YearsASlave and #UndergroundWGN as a result?

###4. Head to the Black Code Studies Github

This is your chance to learn how to use and play with github. You will not be able to edit documents directly. Instead, you will need to make a "pull request" to add or modify any files in the blkcodestudies git. Your only task here is to create a pull request adding a new file to the tumblr folder. 

Documentation to learn how to make a pull request: 
* https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/
* https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

The steps:
* Navigate to the folder modules/tumblr (where the first tumblr assignment is)
* Click: Create a New File - it will give you a notification that you can't make a new file, but a <pre>branch</pre> has been created for you. That's what it is supposed to do. 
* Name your file - The new file should be named: team_#_test with the # = the number of your team (1, 2 or 3). 
* Scroll down and click "Propose new file" - Git will then send you to a page where it compares the changes you requested (i.e. the file you created) with what already exists in the repository in that place to make sure there are no redundancies. 
* Click "Create Pull Request." A comment box will appear. You can ignore this. Click "Create Pull Request" again.

That's that. You've survived your first pull request on Github. If you navigate back to https://github.com/blackcodestudies/blkcodestudies, you should see your file under "Pull Requests" 

We will get more into github and pull requests over the course of the semester. But for now....

You've done three things at this point --

* You've (begun) decoding #UndergroundWGN
* You've (begun) decoding #12YearsASlave
* You've (begun) coding (in the most basic sense) with Git

###5. Report - Due IN MARKDOWN FORMAT

Create a new file (i.e. create a new pull request to add a file to the repository). Name the file anything you wish, but give it an extension of .md for Markdown. Example: Team2Report.md 

* List your annotations of #UndergroundWGN from (#1)
* Describe your research findings from (#2)

In at least 750 words, report back on the work you just completed - Use Fields and the other readings as a resource:

* Barbara Fields wrote: Ideology is the "vocabulary of day-to-day existence, through which people make rough sense of the social reality that they live and create from day to day." What links can you make between ideology, coding and slavery using #12YearsASlave and #UndergroundWGN? 
* Identify "digital resonances" in 12 Years a Slave and UndergroundWGN - things that would only make sense in the digital era now, but that we can also read as being digital in that moment. 
* What is the salience of the past (the history of slavery) in this digital moment?
* Barbara Fields wrote: Ideology is the "vocabulary of day-to-day existence, through which people make rough sense of the social reality that they live and create from day to day."
