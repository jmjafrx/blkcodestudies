Overview
--------

This week’s readings study ways in which black people are surveilled by multiple actors including government, law enforcement, private corporations, and other citizens. Often the purpose of this hyper surveillance is to castigate black communities, demonize individuals, or co-opt the achievements of black people without recognizing them.

**Sydette Harry’s “Everyone Watches, Nobody Sees”** centers on the hyper scrutiny that black women are victim to. She describes surveillance as an act achieved access or force. Often black women are on the receiving end of both force and surveillance. Online, people of color—especially black women—are often fetishized for their habits, lexicon, bodies without permission. Harry questions the risk of over exposure as a counter-method, as traumatic exposure is usually seen within the context of a call-to-action instead of a human being.

**Burges Jules describes the “Documenting the Now”** project, its distillation into various apps, and the implications of social media data collection. A pro is that Twitter data collection gives greater insight into black culture, which is more prevalent than any other racial group. Jules has also recognized the powerful role of Twitter in facilitating resistance movements. Jules recognizes that the DocNow group faces unique issues in the form of government agencies and private consultants that would seek to use their data and pledges to prioritize community support over other interests.

**Browne’s “Everybody’s Got a Little Light Under the Sun”** examines historical examples of surveillance used on slaves, including lantern laws. Browne draws information from The Book of Negroes, a codified public documentation of blacks traveling from New York to Canada. Browne also studies how fugitive slaves subverted surveillance as a means of coping with and escaping imposed rules and enslavement.

**George Joseph’s** article describes the use of Stingray Surveillance, which uses cellphones as cell towers to capture and store content from cellular devices in the periphery. Joseph’s maps of Baltimore, Milwaukee and Tallahassee show that the use of Stingray technology in a neighborhood positively aligns with the percentage of non-white residents. Interesting. Joseph calls into question the legality of law enforcement shatters privacy in this way.

Reflection
----------

Harry’s article reminded me of the black matter mentioned in Tate’s “Black Ontology Now.” Tate describes the unique conditions in which black matter and black creativity are formed into precious cultural fragments. Because dark matter is formed through the negation of white supremacy, it becomes increasingly distant from the center culture as it perfects its “personae and signatures.” Some comfort might be given in the fact that accessing black matter through surveillance rarely equates to recreating or even properly mimicking it.

I’ve read [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-baltimore-secret-surveillance/) seven times and each time I’ve been more miffed than the last.

Comment

@Channing, I think your question about humanizing the movement is a real catch 22. I think the goal of the movement is to make sure that we’re all human in each other’s eyes regardless of attitude or social relation. To show flaws might make the group seems more humble and approachable, but the point of the movement is that human recognition doesn’t require qualification through niceties or humility either. 

Question
--------

* To what degree does surveillance of black differ from black women? How does this manifest itself?
* What’s the boundary between telling a history publicly and sousveillance-as-defeat?
* How can social media platforms be used to protect those who become collateral of dragnet surveillance like Stingray or Persistent Surveillance?
