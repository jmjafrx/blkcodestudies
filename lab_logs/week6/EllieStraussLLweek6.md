#Week 6: Surveillance Systems and Social Media 

##Overview
####**Simone Browne, “Everybody’s Got a Little Light Under the Sun.” Cultural Studies 26, no. 4 (2012): 542–64.**
Simone Browne discusses surveillance technologies through stories of black escape, mostly during the times of the Underground Railroad and the Book of Negroes. She describes how Blacks upholding a history of escapes from the times of slavery up until 20 years ago as Hip Hop music was spreading through New York’s boroughs, constantly finding loopholes, escapes, and forms of expression and revolt from surveillance technologies. She begins the article by referencing two men on the show Mantracker who described their experience on the action show feeling similar to how Blacks felt maneuvering the Underground Railroad. She then goes onto explain how postings about runaways in New York and the Book of Negroes, the first government issued document for state regulated migration between the US and Canada, both shed a new perspective on Black lives to understand the practices, rituals, and acts of freedom against surveillance systems of the time. Blacks came up with various strategies to cope and critique White dominance, through slave songs, riots, and rebellious writing. The detailed documentation of Blacks arriving by boat demonstrates how closely watched they were under a “moment by moment” surveillance team, and how this kind of moment by moment surveillance exists contemporarily.  

####**Racial Disparities in Police “Stingray” Surveillance, Mapped, George Joseph** 

This article explains the racial disparities seen in Stingray surveillance, a tool used by police to pick up people’s texts, locations, and contacts to help inhibit and lower crime rates. But looking closely at the areas where police use Stingray surveillance in urban areas, it becomes clear that they focus on low-income, minority neighborhoods the most heavily. This is the case when looking at data from Baltimore, Tallahassee, and Milwaukee. People living in low-income, majority-non-white neighborhoods are much more likely to be tracked in Stingray than whites. Stingray founders and users claim that it helps find bad guys, but the crimes caught through Stingray are often low-level criminals, not killers or kidnappers. People are increasingly demanding that police be more open and honest about their surveillance use and racist tendencies, but young Blacks still tend to get the most attention from police. 

####**Jules, Bergis. “Surveillance and Social Media Archiving.” Documenting DocNow, October 4, 2016.**

The author explains the ideas behind DocNow, an initiative to value data and the people behind it and creating a community of people who are committed to this focus on “correct” data collection and understanding. Focusing specifically on social media data as important archive-worthy information, DocNow founders try to understand how and why African Americans use social media the way they do today to better understand their issues and concerns. Social Media data is used in a variety of ways today, by historians studying now, by police trying to track “active” citizens, and by radical groups trying to share their ideas to a large audience. 

####**Harry, Sydette. “Everyone Watches, Nobody Sees: How Black Women Disrupt Surveillance Theory.” Model View Culture. Accessed January 12, 2017.** 

Sydette explains how in the age of surveillance, Black women tend to be denied the ability to consent to surveillance. Looking at various Black women such as stars Rihanna and J.Lo who are often sexualized without consent and Janay Rice who received attention after being assaulted by her husband, it becomes clear how much abuse Black women suffer in surveillance, and how race is not yet fully understood and discussed in social media. People do not seem to yet understand or care about the sousurveillance and surveillance pointed on Black people, specifically Black women, without permission. 

##Reflection

These readings are very relevant and informative in understanding the police brutality issues we face today, and how we can explain why police racially profile the way they do. The ubiquitous stories and videos of police violently treating and accusing young Black citizens in particular for crimes they did not commit are alarming. Tracking this heavy surveillance projected on Blacks throughout history makes it clear that this is not a new phenomenon, that we have always historically monitored the “other” with a close eye and have failed to treat them with proper respect. These readings build on some of the subjects discussed in reading for last week about Black use of social media, and how it exists as a form of rebellion against the surveillance system, just as how slaves used the Underground Railroad and anti-slave writings as a way to rebel and speak out against the injustices. 

##Expand 

These readings reminded me of this NPR piece responding to the report published last summer in Baltimore after allegations of police misconduct following the death of Freddie Gray. This one event brought up a much larger issue of police brutality not just in Baltimore, but all over the US, and all over the world in fact.

##Questions

1.	How is Stingray intended to be used in its best possible application? Because it seems that it would only help police bust pretty petty crimes, which they can already do through phone tapping. 
2.	I am somewhat confused with Sydette Harry’s explanation of souserveillance. How is it different from surveillance? 
3.	Does Simone Brown have a problem with the two contestant’s comparison of their experience on a reality action show to that of Blacks on the Underground Railroad? Did this comment receive a lot of backlash when it was first said?
