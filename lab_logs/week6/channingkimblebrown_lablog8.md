## Lab Log #8 | Channing Kimble-Brown

### Overview

**"Everybody’s Got a Little Light Under the Sun"**

* Simone Browne wrote about the Book of Negroes and how the practice of limiting movement based on physical appearance has carried on until today. In the 18th century the British announced that the black slaves of Patriots that could find their way to New York City could join the British and then be permitted safe passage to a life of freedom in Nova Scotia. Rules were created to identify people by their skin, body markings, and sometime skills and the British started issuing birth certificates that acted as a predecessor to passports. Patriots were allowed to come up to NYC and try to claim their ranaways so the black people that were trying to escape had to get creative about why their former masters had no claim, resisting being enslaved again. Browne introduces the idea that black people live in "visual surplus", which seems to mean that black people suffer from this sort of hypervisibility that draws attention to everything that black people do. From this "visual surplus" you get black people exhibiting "performative sensibility", acting a certain way because they don't know who the audience is or if there is an audience to begin with, at all times. This sense was heightend after some slaves burned some property and killed some white people, scaring the white people of New York into creating the "Law for Regulating Negro or Indian Slaves in the Nighttime" which would at first prohibit black people from moving at night without a candle and some years later would prohibit them from moving at night without light and a white escort. As time went on, public assembly was limited in the day and night and black people had to be more creative about how they communicated, using dance, drumming and market trade to social network while white people were watching. Browne concludes by emphasizing the importance of telling the stories of the Book of Negroes from the perspective of black escape in the face of surveillance.

**"U.S. Police Cellphone Surveillance by ‘Stingray,’ Mapped - CityLab"**

* George Joseph reports that Stingrays, devices that mimic cell phone towers to intercept location and the phone numbers of outgoing texts and phone calls, are being used at significantly higher rates in low-income communities of color than in their low-income white counterparts or the wealthier white communities. Baltimore, Tallahassee and Milwaukee in particular have been monitoring and collecting data on these vulnerable communities but refuse to comment on what is happening to that data and Joseph worries that they could be collecting information to create a "pre-suspects" list. People totally uninvolved in investigations are getting caught in the cross-fire, people's information being collected as collateral, and Stingrays are for the most part used for low level crimes like theft. Police are using Stingray information without warrants and without telling the courts that Stingrays are the source of information and Joseph warns us all to be concerned because using these devices in the poor communities of color where is only the beginning.

**"Surveillance and Social Media Archiving"**

* Bergis Jules writes about a group called "Documenting the Now". This group develops tools to collect, analyze and share twitter data and one of their primary concerns is how to ethically curate this information while keeping the privacy and humanity of the users intact and be as transparent as possible while doing so. This data is particularly important because African Americans use Twitter at such high rates and there's so little information on African Americans from the past that this is a great opportunity. The main problem is figuring out whether they should give access to groups that may wish to harm the users. At the end we are directed to a segment of a panel of black activists in a video hosted on YouTube. The moderator asks what the activists wish people would take from social media and what is missing. One activist responded by saying that the internal problems and struggles need to be visible to prevent the alienation of marginalized people within the black community and to humanize the movement. Another said that we need to be wary of elitism and to remember that the fight for justice relies just as heavily on the regular everyday people that you don't see on social media or in the news but still support the activists in crucial ways, keeping strong enough to continue. A third activist said that social media shouldn't be the only focus because the narrative is incomplete and the last activist said that many raw moments and important conversations are not captured on social media, so it really isn't the whole picture. 

**"Everyone Watches, Nobody Sees: How Black Women Disrupt Surveillance Theory"**

* Sydette Harry discusses the surveillance of black women and how to counter it. Black Americans in general have been monitored since they were brought to the US but surveillance has evolved into the media appropriating, fetishing and erasing black culture as a result of trying to understand and profit from black culture without the permission or help of actual black people. Black women have been able to fight back with "sousveillance", the idea of wearing a recording device or (as Harry adds) jamming surveillance. The problem with this practice is that it often requires an exposure of the black woman being surveilled, a willful breach of privacy, and no one seems to stop and wonder if any lines were crossed if sousveillance succesfully stops the surveillance. Sex criminals online that leak nudes of celebrities are targeting black women not simply because they are defenseless but because no one defends them. White women in particular are so busy getting jobs and using the online abuse of women of color as rallying cries that they don't do anything to actually prevent these violations from happening again. Sousveillance really isn't the answer if you just want to be left alone and have some privacy.

### Reflection

Reading these works has given me a different framework for looking at how people interact with black culture and why non-black people can't seem to consume black culture without inflicting some kind of damage or erasing black people altogether. It really reminds me of the Tumblr post that my group made for the Tumblr module that quoted the Louisiana Code Noir. Article 13 said that all free persons had the right and the duty to take any black people that weren't where they were supposed to be directly to the authorities and that was definitely a form of surveillance. It's almost amazing (in the worst way) how many different ways black people are being monitored today. Black people in low income neighborhoods are having cell pone activity stolen, black women online are being stalked and hacked for revenge porn and online harassment, black activists are being monitored by the Federal government. Blackness simultaneously indicts black people as guilty and erases black people's ownership and right to black culture and black humanity in general. I really am not sure how the DocNow team is going to be able to work with this data without exploiting and endangering black people in some way, I'm curious to see what the finished products will look like.

![Diamond Reynolds and Dae'Anna](http://funds.gfmcdn.com/12758333_1467929267.1861.jpg)

This is Diamond Reynolds holding her daughter Dae'Anna. Reynolds' boyfriend Philando Castile was a black man that was pulled over by a police officer with Reynolds and Dae'Anna both in the car. As Philando reached for the ID that the officer asked for, the officer shot Philando seven times and Reynolds livestreamed the entire tragedy to Facebook. Later there were stories about the family being pulled over in the first place because the car had a broken tail light and Philando looking like a suspect in an ared robbery that had recently taken place in the area. Regardless of why they were pulled over, Reynolds was forced into a position where she had to expose her terror and mourning to the world in order to prevent further violence against herself and her 4 year old. She very much had to use "sousveillance" and leverage her livestream to discourage the officers from going any further. The entire situation was heartwrenching and she had to put so much pain and death on display for the world to take notice and do anything about it. In the end you have to wonder how much good it did because her boyfriend was still murdered and she still has to deal with all the aftermath. The fact that it started with police surveillance and ended with her sousveillance is haunting and makes you wonder if minimizing extreme violence is really the best that we can hope for when fighting back with sousveillance alone.

### Comment

In response to JB's [first question](https://github.com/jrbrown2017/blkcodestudies/blob/738d5d6920485fcfbd81cbf19c1fa38f7926b589/lab_logs/week6/JB%20Lab%20Log%208.md), I'd say that there's a line somewhere between just following someone casually online and actually stalking and surveilling them. In reference to black men in particular, I'd say that watching and harassing women in the street is definitely a form of surveillance. Just viewing the pictures a woman posts to Instagram is something else. I think that the key distinguishing factor is consent and agency. The photos being posted are meant to be seen by the public, the woman presumably consented to the photos being taken and posted if she didn't do it herself. Sliding into her DMs also probably doesn't count as surveillance if she is open to that, especially since she can control her privacy settings and block people as necessary. Now if you were to constantly create new accounts to keep harassing her and ignoring her wishes then there would be a problem. As long as your respect for the other person doesn't hinge on how receptive they are to your advances then it's all good. The real problem is when black women are in positions where they have no choice but to be monitored, especially by black men in their own communities, often in the interest of controlling black women's behavior in some way. Black men can do what all men should do. Listen to people when they say they don't feel safe or comfortable, respect people's boundaries and never feel entitled to anyone's time, space or personal information. And holding other men accountable for problematic behavior doesn't hurt either, online and in real life.

### Question

0. Is there any way to effectively fight surveillance other than sousveillance? Is there any solution that is less invasive and dangerous to the person being monitored?
0. How widespread is the use of Stingrays by the FBI? Is it effective for them? Can this kind of surveillance ever really be justified when so many other innocent people are affected just by being in the vicinity?
0. Do you think that letting the world see that the movement is imperfect humanizes the movement? Will more non-black people be inclined to join the cause because the movement's flaws are exposed? Will more black people be incline to join?
