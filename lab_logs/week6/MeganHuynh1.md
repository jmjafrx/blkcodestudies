# OVERVIEW:
Everyone Watches Nobody Sees:
Discusses how surveillance in America is based on the presumption that access is a right and those are being surveilled, especially for Black women, will not or can not say no. Harry says that Black women are studied and portrayed online as “raving amazons,” which welcomes “racist condescension” and historical abuse to Black women. An example of how Black women have been discredited is through the big booty movement in which Jennifer Lopez was credited for paving the way for Rihanna to walk off with a Fashion Icon Award. 

Documenting the Now:
Documenting the Now is a tool that helps analyze, collect, and share Twitter data. The social media collected from Twitter, especially with the Black Lives Movement, is important for the work of libraries and archives because it documents an important time for African American history and culture. Jules states that one of the issues with their project is that private security firms want to use the data not to enrich the Black community but to persecute them for being activists. 

Racial Disparities in Police Surveillance:
The article discusses how Stingray phone trackers have been used in domestic law enforcement. The problem with the technology is that it is only approximate and innocent people can get caught up in the cross fires. The data gathered from CityLab revealed that police forces used Stingrays in predominantly non-white and low-income communities (AKA overwhelmingly Black communities). This poses a risk to civil liberties and violations of privacy. However, some argue that these areas coincidentally happen to be located in hotspot areas and it has nothing to do with race. 

Everybody’s Got a Little Light Under the Sun
Links the tradition of surveillance of Black people back to slavery in which systems were devised to track where ex-slaves or fugitives were going. She also discusses how the physical boundaries of where slaves would flee to were also confined to their perception of the Black body and the visibility of escape and freedom. 

# REFLECTION:
Similar to many of the topics we discussed in class such as Black fugitivity and Black machines, the issues of Black America date back to slavery. I wonder if this type of issues seen in minority and low-income groups in other countries are a result of historical instances such as slavery. The first that would come to mind is in France in there is a lot of evidence of French colonization to control Black communities in the Caribbean and in parts of Africa. I have visited places such as St. Lucia and they do not seem to have such societal problems as we have in America, but perhaps that is because white French people do not dominate the island. 

# EXPAND:
Upon wishing to figure out JHU’s historical relationship with the African American community, I came across this website. http://afam.nts.jhu.edu/about
It is an exhibition that focuses on African American contributions and experiences to Johns Hopkins’ community. 

# COMMENT:
Zoya: Will future textbooks include some aspect of what we have discussed in class, and particularly in these readings? Will they include the pros and cons of using social media in the Black Lives Matter movement? 
I absolutely think in less than a decade, history textbooks on American History will discuss the importance and impact of the Black Lives Matter movement through social media. I think this because it is one of the first of its kind in America in which many people are united through the use of technology to fight against a social injustice they seek to make change in. 

# QUESTION:
1.	In Everyone Watches, Nobody Sees it emphasizes the fact that Black women are carefully watched and then people are deliberately abusing them. However, what is more prevalent in the world? Deliberate attempts to abuse Black women or the unconsciousness of stealing what Black women make popular? Which is more dangerous?
2.	What laws are being written to protect against these infringements against privacy and security? Are legislators not worried because it is happening to a community that is not powerful enough to fight back?
3.	Why aren’t Stingrays also used for law enforcement that targets high-income and white communities? For example, police may need to use this type of technology for espionage or other criminal acts that is more common amongst un-assuming middle to high classes.
