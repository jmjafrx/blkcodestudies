# Overview

* Simone Browne, “Everybody’s Got a Little Light Under the Sun.” Cultural Studies 26, no. 4 (2012): 542–64.

Throughout this article Simone Browne recounts the history of black surveillance through the means of lanterns, legislation on the amount of black people that could gather at a time, and The Book of Negroes. Starting with a synopsis of the show *Mantracker,* Browne focuses on how this reality televison show paralells with the realities that faced free and enslaved black people. Once this comparison has been established, Browne moves on to describe the entries within The Book of Negroes and just how focused they were on physical appearance of the subjects they wrote about. They also explain the concept of Birch Certificates and how they were used to claim slaves that tried to escape, particularly in this article to Nova Scotia. Browne then describes the plight of black individuals in New York and how they was a point where after sundown, there had to be 1 lamp for 3 black people. During this section, readers also learn about the public dance rituals that many black slaves were forced to be a part of. In the third and final section of this article, Browne emphasizes on the importance of the Birch Certificate, especially in the process after the Revolutionary War and where these slaves were to go according to the certificates.

* Joseph, George. “U.S. Police Cellphone Surveillance by ‘Stingray,’ Mapped - CityLab.”

In this brief online article, George Joseph discusses a very "hush-hush" data collector in big cities known as Stingray. This program mimics that of cellular towers and gathers information about the cell phones being used in the areas that surround it. In 3 cities: Baltimore, Tallahasee, and Milwaukee, we see data that maps out the highest placement and usage of the Stingray programs are centered around areas that are high in poor and minority poplation. When taking away the minority factor, and only looking at white, working-class neighborhoods, there is still a decrease in Stingray usage. This program has already undergone legal scrutiny throough groups like the ACLU and The Movement for Black Lives, and all three cities' police departments have signed non-disclosure agreements with the FBI in order to keep using the program.

* Jules, Bergis. “Surveillance and Social Media Archiving.” Documenting DocNow, October 4, 2016.

In the synopsis of the up and coming program Documenting the Now or DocNow, Bergis Jules, one of its creators, goes over both the inspiration for the project and the concerns she has dealing with Twitter data. She explains that DocNow was created in response to the killing of Michael Brown and making sure there was a way preserve information on social media in the long-term. Jules also spends time mentioning her colleagues and the other universities involved that made this endeavor possible. After this she briefly mentions that a worry her and her associates have is that when groups who do not wish to advocate for marginalized groups become interested in this data, what are their intentions? The article closes with a link to the DocNow's first advisory board meeting.

* Harry, Sydette. “Everyone Watches, Nobody Sees: How Black Women Disrupt Surveillance Theory.” Model View Culture.

Throughout this piece we watch as Sydette Harry establishes the prevalence of surveillance of black women on and off-line. Harry mentions not only the stereotypical idea of surveillance with physical cameras, and in this case, body cameras with agile mobility, but she also mentions the erasure of black women's contributions at all. One example of this was seen when Rihanna wore the Swarvoski crsytal dress and how a person gave credit for Jennifer Lopez for starting a movement of sensuality, when in reality it was in ode to Josephine Baker. The constant battle between begging to be seen while also demandind privacy is a problem that is very well illuminated in this article.


# Reflection

The very last article struck me the most with this Lab Log assignment and here's why: the attention to the dichotomy that exists with black women being fetishized to a point of obsession and simultaneously a point of erasure. It's a concept that I have never been able to put into words around other people, and to be able to read about it in an article that is clear and concise was not only refreshing but relieving. My inability to explain that relationship made me feel as if maybe I was interpreting my own experience incorrectly.

# Comment

In response to Megan's question, are black students more politically active than other races on college campuses, I think that depends on what your definition of politically active is. If it means doing the grassroots work and participating in protests and marches then yes, I feel like that's clear. But if you consider political activism to be canvassing in the community or being involved in political groups on campus then no. In the latter I feel as if more white students are involved in these activities because they hold some future value that applies to them, being involved through a consistent program on campus can only look good, however you cannot put "attended a rally" on a resume. The might be a stretch but the racial tendencies are defintely confirmable.


# Question

* What is the first step to reclaming black women's visibility?

* Is it really possible for 2 black men running away from a white man on a horse to be respectful of history?

* If data is public domain, then what can we do about people using it in a conpletely legal, yet marginalizing way?

* Are there more programs like Stingray? And if so, will bringing more attention to them bring about their end?
