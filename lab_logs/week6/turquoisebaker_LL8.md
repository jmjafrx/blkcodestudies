#### Overview 

Browne, Simone “Everybody’s Got a Little Light Under the Sun.” Cultural Studies 26, no. 4 (2012): 542–64.

- Referencing contemporary examples like an episode of the television series *Mantracker*, and historical examples like The Book of Negroes and the Lantern laws, Simone Browne explains the role of surveillance in Black American and Canadian history. Browne begins with the show *Mantracker*, in which the “prey” must reach a finish line in 36 hours that is 40 km away, before being caught by the Mantracker, a man on horseback (Browne 543). The episode following two black men running from a white Mantracker allows for a “deeper discussion of black mobilites, the visual culture of surveillance and The Book of Negroes”: a leather bound, hand-written book listing 3,000 Black passengers on (mostly) British ships headed to New York in 1783 (Browne 545). The mobility of Blacks was also regulated with the New York City Lantern laws in the 1700s, which made it illegal for Blacks over 14 years of age to be near the Manhattan Fresh Water Pond without a lantern or lit candle. These precautions taken centuries ago to keep blacks in a “state of permanent illumination” allude to a similar sentiments and actions taken towards Blacks today (Browne 546).  

Joseph, George. “U.S. Police Cellphone Surveillance by ‘Stingray,’ Mapped - CityLab.”  

- In George Joseph’s article, Joseph looks at “Stingray” surveillance in three large American cities: Milwaukee, Tallahassee, and Baltimore. Stingray is a phone tracking program able to identify the “phone’s location, number, and the phone numbers that ongoing calls are being sent to within in a certain radius”. This program is often used in lieu of a warrant or disclosure to search. Mapping is able to target minority groups, which in the study, were mostly Black and Hispanic lower-income neighborhoods. None of the Police Departments in these cities commented on CityLab interview requests, having signed FBI nondisclosure agreement to keep the matters secret.  

Jules, Bergis. “Surveillance and Social Media Archiving.” Documenting DocNow, October 4, 2016

- “Surveillance and Social Media Archiving” is about “Documenting the Now”, a joint project between UC Riverside, the Maryland Institute for Technology, in the Humanities at the University of Maryland and the Washington University of St. Louis. Members in the project aim to correctly compile, distribute and analyze social media, especially tweets. DocNow aims to create a transparent collection of this data, and a space for a humanized narrative. In the future, they must work with the Library of Congress to create ensure that the archives are as transparent as possible. 

Harry, Sydette. “Everyone Watches, Nobody Sees: How Black Women Disrupt Surveillance Theory.” Model View Culture. 

- This article is not just about “surveillance” as mentioned in Joseph’s article, but surveillance of Black women: how we see Black women in black culture, how to give them credit for their contributions, and how to recognize their struggle. Sydette Harry gives the example of “big booty era” as a “high fashion moment” which is often credited to women like Jennifer Lopez and Iggy Azalea. Therefore, according to Harry, the ridicule Blacks have faced for having that body shape is diminished. This is an unrelenting pattern. There will be sympathy for a white woman who experienced revenge porn threats, even though women of all colors have faced these threats for years with hardly any coverage. Harry concludes her work by asking the audience, “What is the solution for being constantly watched, if no one sees you at all?”

#### Reflection

- I found the study of “surveillance” very interesting, and equally as ironic. Even though Blacks are often viewed as threats to be feared, this demographic is arguably the most the watched. The amount of research on this topic goes to show how many ways Black “surveillance” manifests itself in our society today, and how easy it is for Black to understand this phenomenon as “normal”. 

#### Expand

- I lived in Milwaukee for about 15 years and therefore found George Joseph’s article “U.S. Police Cellphone Surveillance by ‘Stingray,’ particularly interesting. Knowing Milwaukee made me realize how exceedingly easy it is to surveil blacks in the city and county, considering how segregated Milwaukee is. For the past few years, Milwaukee has been amongst the top 10 most segregated cities in America. Below is a Milwaukee Segregation Map from the *New York Times* in 2015. ![map](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qxbayI5F2ZGmVBGpgZUQ4tWeEvTj7UoOM-Q19Buy54cU4E0q0P5Z3mFihxlzY1cP3E0eRciRF84UcGxiCS4xk7DYg7YUBBb0dflICWl9g-075NiFAZ7k7PjYtH217S3XIgLIBdEVpElfGBhvL_3uDmco5-7CKt88UFOu5R_QN_QC33JoLL75-tGyTTKOOtX6vP0DDtjvU4JZE-D0H39usZ878bNYm6sKLcyuWwfDxxc9rUG3TnhOhnSuX8PsQ5hVMEclhH4iblShxHnB0YI01T5vmjJCXmVZsqQ-ZM884xWblWU4uCsUmawRsviWO7xXJc9N_dflppwI16RddojD3SGMS1B_NJJegfjWkdCSYsYtUUhn5y6jJCTHRLdVmGncyF7LuPfW5dclbLf0M6_j3XojBajeP6fRLeVOSZDwHtzK13iXucM7G1rEABFcJb5J1RV5bFgRWfd2bXnDCUBBgiPNkAy1dAupJQo5daPYWy_onldVlNawwUEhPFzQBMKcJP69GXqyMRcHKopPaHwxTzhihtcSGhRPdr96PAoiA1dBIM5Lp2z6dAkfBCnPPRu3G__EZ7c2W2nXGlR1U-gVDd1cBqrgGwrDMy-dS0ev0-PRo4uFBqE=w1435-h589-no)

#### Comment

- In response to the first part JB’s question from Lab Log 5, I think a lot of publishing companies, book sellers, and even readers, believe that if something is made by a Black individual, and not “explicitly” about the “Black struggle”, it won’t sell, or it's not legitimate. This really annoys me, not just because it leads people to wrongfully assume that Black people can only be good at “Black people things”, but it also promotes the exploitation of Black people. Additionally, although Blacks have been living the “alien, science fiction narrative” for centuries, Black writers have been in the industry for a shorter amount of time. This, nonetheless, is no excuse for the poor representation and lack of respect in the genre. 

#### Question

- While segregation legislation was created because of deeply rooted racism, how much of their creation can we attribute to the desire to surveil these communities?
- There has been a trend of “big booty” fashion in the past few years (Nicki Minaj, Kim Kardashian, Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez etc.). Why does a Black woman with larger assets have to be famous or explicitly fetishized in order for her to receive praise rather than ridicule? 
- In what other ways is the mobility of blacks (or other demographics) staunched in cities like Baltimore, Milwaukee, New York City, etc. Where should the line be drawn between “safety precautions” and blatant invasive profiling?
