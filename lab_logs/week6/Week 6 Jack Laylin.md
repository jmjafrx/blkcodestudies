Lab Log 7

# Overview: 

### Simone Browne - “Everybody’s Got a Little Light Under the Sun.”

Browne discussed various forms of black data, like The Book of Negroes, which contained information on the slaves aboard 219 ships. As one of the first printed documentations of black populations in America, Browne argues that the Book of Negroes supported the invention of the modern passport system. Another form of surveillance was levied on black people in New York—the lantern. Visualized as a “prothesis made mandatory after dark,” the lantern was designed to keep black bodies illuminated and identifiable to prevent pernicious behavior. There is a long tradition of black surveillance that is mirrored in the present.

### George Joseph -  “U.S. Police Cellphone Surveillance by ‘Stingray,’ Mapped - CityLab.”

The “stingray” is a mysterious device used by police to track cellphones. It isn’t perfect, so sometimes it leads to unnecessary confrontation with unlucky individuals. The technology is sometimes used without a warrant and often targets non-white low-income communities. Sometimes, like in Milwaukee, police target black residents regardless of income. Moreover, stingray is often used to track low-level criminals The article also proposes a series of civil rights issues due to how collateral data is being stored and used.

### Bergis Jules - “Surveillance and Social Media Archiving.”

Jules describes the “Documenting the Now” project, which is a tool to archive twitter data. The project was inspired by the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson. The founders saw a need to archive post-event twitter information as a crucial part of that event’s history and African-American culture. The project is very careful to respect the ownership, creativity, and rights of the twitter users whose data will be collected.

### Harry, Sydette. “Everyone Watches, Nobody Sees”

Sydette discusses how we are all forced to participate in the digital world and therefore offer ourselves up to surveillance and judgement. The author specifically delves into the plight of black women on the internet, who are given no respect or agency and often objectified for the purpose of dissection. Mentioning icons like Rihanna, Viola Davis, and Shonda Rhimes, Sydette builds a clear argument that black women’s rights and achievements are regularly ignored in the media and online. Also mentioned is an anti-surveillance concept known as “sousveillance,” which centers on using technology to thwart surveillance of yourself or others. The author calls this a “reminder of defeat.”

# Reflect:

I had never heard of the lantern law before. While it’s not the worst thing that happened to black people in early America, it surprised me because it actually does not feel like an anachronism today. Sans lanterns, black people are still killed or harassed for walking alone on the street. Surveilling their movement has never left the white American consciousness. The stingray technology surprised me because there has been zero regulation, community notification, voting, or legal process to approve its use. Maybe I’m being an optimist, but shouldn’t something so powerful be voted on? The Jules and Sydette articles tackle a space that I don’t think can ever safe—The Internet. I am definitely being a pessimist in this situation, but I don’t think it is unwarranted. Collecting data and then hoping that other users don’t mine the same data or use it as respectfully as you is a social contract that nobody agreed to. Similarly, the horrific abuse and disrespect of black women on the internet obviously must be stopped, but how? A closet racist will always have that platform to express themselves anonymously.

# Expand:

We live in an interesting city to study black surveillance, considering the Citiwatch program has 700 cameras in mostly black neighborhoods throughout the city. Read about it [here](http://www.citypaper.com/news/features/bcp-012716-night-citiwatch-20160127-story.html).

# Comment:

Ellie asked what the difference between surveillance and sousveillance is. While I don’t understand the genesis of the actual sous- prefix, I think it means a sort of anti-surveillance aimed at preventing those in authority positions from being the only account of a situation. This is accomplished by taking advantage of the same tech that, say, the police use to prevent abuses of power. 

# Question:

1. Will we ever be able to take the human element—which allows for racial targeting—out of surveillance technologies like Stingray?
2. Why wasn’t use of the stingray technology a public decision?
3. Is it possible to create black safe spaces on the internet?
