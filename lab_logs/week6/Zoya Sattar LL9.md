### Overview
* *Derrick Bell, "Space Traders" Faces at the Bottom of the Well*
A stunning capture of how America treats its black citizens. What was satire, what was over exaggerated in this piece? The sad answer is nothing. This all held true for how America would have reacted in the face of such a trade. There were far too many subtleties and hidden disparaging remarks to only go through this reading once. Even after multiple readings, I am still stunned. Ball showcases how convoluted America has become, and what happens when the big ugly head of racism finally has the chance to rear its head untethered. 

* *McMillan, Uri. “Ellen Craft’s Radical Techniques of Subversion.”*
McMillan looks at Ellen Craft's usage of performance to escape slavery. Drawing parallels with Craft's work and that of drag queens, McMillan works to prove the importance of 'being' what one is attempting to portray in order to be successful. Ellen Craft disrupts the drawn lines dictating what is beauty, femininity, and blackness, what are racial, class, and gender categories in the 19th century. Focusing on Craft's curtsy in front of a gathering, McMillan continues in showcasing Ellen's smashing apart of several misbeliefs society held about coloured women, and what peoples expectations for coloured women were and are. 

* *Crockett, I’Nasah. “‘Raving Amazons’: Antiblackness and Misogynoir in Social Media.”*
Reviewing this article in the context of this week's topic, the topic of 'the afterlife of slavery' is still relevant. But in this week's context, it comes to mean how black women have been stereotyped for centuries, as expressed by the 4Chan incident and the white feminism movement. Surveillance and harassment of black women is something black communities have always had the knowledge of having to deal with. Pulling from a book written 104 years ago that called black women Raving Amazons, savage with uncontrolled anger, Crockett questions whether any progress has truly been made with changing the white feminist mindset. 
### Reflection
What is black knowing? Through the course of this week's readings, I've come to take it as the knowledge black people have always held about how white people truly regard them in this world. It is the knowledge of the countless barriers and expectations that black people are forced to deal with while living in America. The knowledge that they have always been perceived in a negative light, and this perception translates into a hellish daily existence for them.

Bell's reading had me feeling ways I didn't know were possible right after a midterm. Outrage, sadness, puzzlement while trying to determine if this was meant to be satire, as it was a depiction of real life one would be hard pressed to find humor in. The most captivating reading in class so far. Throughout, I struggled with my realizations that were such a thing to happen right now, the outcome would be the same. What I found interesting was Bell's lack of use of the perspective of a 'normal' black family throughout this piece of the continuously warring different sides of America.

An important event from the last two days, Representative King's comments on wanting a 'homogeneous' America seems eerily familiar to Bell's piece.
### Comment
To answer JB's third question from last week's lab log, I think that we are now living in a world where archiving exists side by side with history being made. With the rise of social media and globalization, something controversial is happening on a daily basis around the world. 
### Questions
* Were there any other slaves who escaped using a similar form of deception as Ellen and William Craft?
* How can we circulate Bell's piece more widely? I need everyone to read this. Also what does the rest of the book consist of?
* Would Ellen Craft's performance be considered performance in its purest form, used to truly transform someone's demeanor by slipping into another character in order to wholeheartedly fool everyone into believing the fake persona as real?
