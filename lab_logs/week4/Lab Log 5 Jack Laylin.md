Lab Log 5

# Overview: 

### Last Angel of History

This is a quasi-documentary about traditions of black music, specifically Afrofuturism. Via off-kilter interviews, narration, and a “Data Thief” character, the film both comments on and becomes a part of the Afrofuturistic narrative, itself a commentary on the diaspora of black culture. A few different Black artists are mention or interviewed, including George Clinton, Lee Perry, and Sun Ra. The Data Thief is a curious character that travels through time and space, trying to collect the fragments necessary to unlock the future. George Clinton references that future multiple times in his interview and music, describing a cosmological, extraterrestrial, and specifically black future. The film’s aesthetic mirrors this ideology and vision. 

### Eshun

Eshun discusses the United Kingdom’s Black film industry. Through touchstones such as Handsworth Songs, Eshun argues for a certain renaissance despite a lack of cultural support in Britain. Institutions like the BAFC are leading this charge by challenging stereotypes of black high art. The piece presupposes a lot of background knowledge of black cinema, actors, and black British culture that makes it difficult to follow.

### Tate

Tate talks about the black body as a performance vehicle, and how black history is most accurately and authentically understood through black music. During the 19th century in the American South, slaves would competitively show up their masters with “vigorous exertions.” The article then transitions to a sort of slam poetry-cum-rap song with prophetic interludes that covers everything from Christina Aguilera to Erykah Badu to free jazz and Jesus. The author then describes how “Dark Energy,” previously an exclusively cosmological thought, is also a black thought. Finally, Tate delves into the power of Black high art over music. He tells of the museum usurping the radio as the home of hard-hitting questions of blackness.

### Felton and Solomon Tumblr

The Sally Hemings Dreams Tumblr is an art piece of sliding panes, each emblazoned with a quote or song or sound bite. In concert, it describes the “conscious and unconscious thoughts of women of African descent” as slaves. The multimedia experience is decorated with cloud textures, geometric cicada wings, and watercolor inkblots. The quotes reference unfreedom, manumission, and field work in oblique ways that represent fetal abolitionist and feminist ideas. 

# Reflection:

The most divisive of these pieces, Last Angel of History, was such a mind bender that I struggled to describe it. Firstly, I think the concept of time traveling to grow a united black future out of black diaspora was muddied by the unhinged visuals. Perhaps that was the point. I felt fully unenlightened when watching the film, as I think it presumes a ton of knowledge that I don’t yet have. As in the film, Eshun contributes to this exclusive feeling with a piece of writing that I can only describe as targeted for a narrow audience. Tate’s article, on the other hand, had me floored. The writing, originality, and energy of the piece was a new experience that I enjoyed. The concept of blackness as Dark Energy or the genesis of all things was an incredible metaphor for how Western culture appropriates and commercializes the black performance/body/art. Finally, the Tumblr art project provided a thoughtful experiential component to the readings. I can’t bring myself to say it allowed me to step back in time or some other such cliché, but it was a well-designed piece of multimedia art.

This isn’t wholly related, but the mention of Gaga reminded me that even our cultural icons who have strong activist and inclusionary reputations can still be problematic. [Ergo, my new favorite website.](http://yourfaveisproblematic.tumblr.com/post/45739943624/lady-gaga)

# Comment:

JB asked if there is any way we can regulate hate speech on Twitter. I have a two part response. First, I think hateful people will always find an outlet for their hate. Keying certain words as objectionable or blocking accounts is like cutting a head off of a hydra. Second, and this is just me postulating, is the availability of an outlet for that hate speech perhaps a useful catalyst for efforts to fight it? Do we need people to be their bigoted selves on the internet to feel like action is necessary? I guess a corollary to these questions is to what extent we should be removing hate speech from sites like Twitter. I’m not saying I feel a certain way, just posing the questions.

# Question:

1. Should I have understood the film and Eshun’s article more than I think I did? I realize I am not the intended audience, and I will not criticize the films for being focused on serving a particular community, but were they intentionally crafted as such?

2. Is the “Lady Gaga” test posed by Tate a racial or gendered test? Or both?

3. What can we do to recognize the influence of Black Art in all forms of mainstream art?
