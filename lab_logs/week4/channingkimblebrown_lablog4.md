## Lab Log #4 | Channing Kimble-Brown

### Overview

**"US Operating Systems at Mid-Century"**

* This piece written by  Tara McPherson discusses the parallels between various UNIX operating system philosophies and how the United States shifted our politics to be more modular and encapsulted from the 1960s to today. She argues that while computer programmers didn't necessarily cause this directly, the philosphy of simplifying and separating issues into interchangeable modules has very much affected the humanities and scienes as well. Areas of study are rigidly divided with very little crossover or collaberation, especially between the humanities and computer science. She claims that this divide needs to end because the development of software and  computers happened in the exact same era of the Civil Rights movement and various other social justice initiatives all over the world. The metaphorical operating system that underlies how academics work today needs to be updated so that academics of various disciplines can actively learn about how software and digital media are created and the racial and social implications that haven't really been considered before.

**"The Uncanny History of Minstrels and Machines, 1835-1923"**

* This piece written by Louis Chude-Sokei focuses on rise of minstrelsy in conjunction with technology in American pop culture. The piece begins with the first use of a black person being advertised the American masses, Joice Heth. P.T. Barnum purchases her and later increases her appeal as a carnival attraction by claiming she's an automaton. The rest of this essay discusses how white people transitioned from using Sambo as entertainment to Zip Coon during industrialization. Chude-Sokei claims that both blackface and stories about technology rising up and enslaving their (white) human masters allowed white people to express anxieties about the post-Civil War translation of slaves into humans. He brings up various historians trying to understand why blackface came about and some concluded that white people were torn between creating an African aesthetic, tying black people abroad and on the African continent to "nature" and being brute beasts, but at the same time seeing them as objects or tools to be used and abused. The "liminality" of black people gave them an uncanny quality, both amusing and terrifying white people because they found the idea of a human like thing acting like an object humorous but the idea of a mechanical object mimicking humans unpleasant, leaving black people difficult to categorize by such racist standards.

**"On Its 10th Birthday, a Short History of Twitter in Tweets | WIRED"**

* This article from WIRED by Julia Greenburg quickly touches on various aspects of Twitter and a few milestones over the last ten years. She touches on how Twitter has become so widely used for everything from socializing to political movements to celebrity to advertisement. Tweets have become a significant enough snapshot of our culture that the Library of Congress is archiving every single tweet. Both news and just weird thoughts spread rapidly on this platform. It serves as a double-edged sword, lifting the voices of marginalized communities but also exposing them to new levels of harassment. The article overall seems to suggest that it is all of these things but for Greenburg Twitter is essentially a pleasant distraction.

**"How Black People May Or May Not Use Twitter"**

* This article written by Sam Sanders from NPR discusses the behavior of black teens and twenty somethings on Twitter, particularly in reaction to an article written before this called "How Black People Use Twitter" by Farhad Manjoo that had a striking illustration of the Twitter bird with brown skin, a snapback and a phone alluding to black Twitter users. Sanders' piece both reiterates what Manjoo says about young black users tweeting in a much more social and connected way and refutes Manjoo with the opinions of various other black people that don't feel like there is anything particularly special about black Twitter users. The piece very much is exactly what the title implies and takes neither side in the issue.

**"How Black Lives Matter Uses Social Media to Fight the Power"**

* This article from WIRED, written by Bijan Stephen, starts off talking about how "live tweeting" back in the 60s involved making a phone call to a national organization that would always have people ready to take down notes on reports of civil rights news and then compile the stories that came in to mail out to other organizers, leaders, justice departments, news reporters, etc. It took a lot of infrastructure and the most effective way to get out a message to the country was to get traditional media involved, like ABC News. The tools we have today for mass communications completely change black activism and the strategies that can be used to communicate both privately and publicly on whatever scale is deemed necessary. Especially after #BlackLivesMatter caught on, coined by Alicia Garza in response to George Zimmerman murdering Trayvon Martin without punishment, Maurice Mitchell says that the Black Lives Matter movement is much less centralized than the civil rights movement of the 60s but still manages to be coordinated. While technology has made all of this possible, it has also introduced black people to new kinds of abuse online. A lot of abuse is violent but poeple take it less seriously since it's usually anonymous and disembodied. There's also the issue of surveillance of Black Lives Matter leaders and activists by law enforcement. But nonetheless, the movement has at times been extremely effective. The last effect of social media discussed in this piece is how much it has changed the black experience in America. Technology has made it much easier to expose young black people to black intellectual thought and help the youth understand and articulate their experiences with racism. Stephen feels that we are heading toward a collective consiousness about racism and an understanding of how broken the system really is from continuous sources that are "as near to us as our screens".

### Reflection

Most of these pieces touch on the interaction between blackness and technology whether it's about how the black people have used technology or how people's interpretations of blackness affect and are affected by the development of technology since machines were first introduced to America. It feels like technology as we understand it today started off as a weapon to be used against black people but much like we've tried to do with every other aspect of society, we've managed to find some way to make the tools of our oppressors work for us. Black people were dehumanized and advertized as carnival attractions to make white people feel better about all of the atrocities they committed but even in the 60s black people were organizing themselves and taking advantage of WAN lines, maintaining some form of communication in spite of surveillance and violence. It very much seems like not much has changed though because the comments about non-black people enjoying peering in on what black people are doing on Twitter and treating it like some form of special entertainment feels a bit like they are attendng minstrel shows to see their caricatured ideas of black people confirmed. The paper about the development of UNIX during the progression of several social movements was particularly interesting because Computer Science is still very much taught following those exact principles and the tech industry has massive problems with discrimination, diversity and racism. We are taught that encapsulation and modularity are key and now I have to wonder if that has become the life philosophy of many computer scientists because on the rare occasion that I meet someone else interested in social issues they are always a non-black woman and more focused on sexism. I definitely agree with the idea of humanities and computer scientists bridging the gap and having real conversation and thought about how historical racism in this country and around the work factors into computer science and software development today.

**The History Of American Slang**

While the Buzzfeed video linked in the image above is a bit on the silly side and they don't have any actual citations in the description indicating that this came from actual research, I feel like it thematically cuts to the heart of what a lot of the pieces we read talk about, which is the fascination that non-black people seem to have with black culture and their need to appropriate it and turn it into something more palatable without crediting the source (often simultaneously condemning the source). Language and culture is so deeply rooted in black culture in ways that a lot of us aren't even aware of.

### Comment

Jack posted an image of a BLM protest with a sign that says "Hashtags are the new protest signs" and I find that interesting I agree but it made me think about how they do more than that. Protest signs serve to as a way to draw attention and get a point across to passersby, much like a hashtag would to someone browsing Twitter. But I also think the activism hashtags do more. They have a much more logistic purpose, making it easy to find out what discussions are taking place around a particular subject and indexing those discussions with short names or phrases. It makes exposure to these kinds of topics easier and wider reaching than ever before. People that may live in places that never protest can learn about a national movement and hear several different takes on the history, present day context and possible future implications on their phones.

### Question
0. How did they man these WATS lines in the 60s? Or generally, how did this whole infrastructure get set up in the first place? The fact that they had to do all this is fascinating to me.
0. I wonder how Twitter is used across the African diaspora. If you read the article written by Manjoo he mentions that one hashtag went viral because a South African person picked it up from an African American in the US and it exploded from there. Are the trending hashtags in other countries driven by their black citizens?
0. Which social media platforms are the most safe, effective or commonly used for black activism? Or is it specific to the type of information you want to get out there?
