## Overview:
This week's readings delve into the realm of social media, bringing to the forefront the importance of social media in combating injustice, while the tech that allows for such action has covert racism ingrained in the systems. Activists have utilized social media to aid them in bring justice more swiftly than in the past. 

We begin with a short history of twitter in “On Its 10th Birthday, a Short History of Twitter in Tweets | WIRED.” This compilation of the first tweet in 2006 to present day showcases how Twitter has transformed from an ordinary day-to-day discussion platform (that right is now associated with Facebook) to the politically rousing activist community that exists today in the twitter sphere.

In “How Black Lives Matter Uses Social Media to Fight the Power", Bijan Stephen discusses how BLM has utilized twitter to streamline its mission. I have to take a second to admire how the article was set up. Scrolling through words with pictures peeking through add a sense of fleeting time. You have to consciously make the decision to view the pictures or read the article, which makes it more enjoyable to do either action. Back to the article itself, an important point made is that the need for institutions is not as heavily required in order to push for change. Social media has changed how justice can be achieved, and has revealed another way for  hopefully achieving racial equality in America.

Sam Sander's article on “How Black People May Or May Not Use Twitter" tackles the long held stereotype that any group of colour belongs to a monolith of the same likes, dislikes, personalities, and backgrounds. With his title parodying the discussed article "How Black People Use Twitter", Sander brings up how ridiculous the original article. Manjoo claims he 'wanted to ask some interesting questions' by writing such an article, but as Sanders points out, what black people were doing on Twitter was very similar to what other people were doing. This goes back to the whole idea that black people and culture is not a monolith, and one cannot use the basis of a few individuals to claim that an entire race behaves the same way. Social media tastes and actions vary as diversely as our personalities and experiences. 

In “US Operating Systems at Mid-Century", Tara McPherson uses UNIX to showcase how the lenticular lenses are found in our computational systems, aka how covert racism exists in modern technology and how this came to be. Modularity was heavily stressed in the making of UNIX, which in software design means to decrease 'global complexity' and cleanly separate 'neighbors' from one another. She puts forth the idea that our technological and racial formation are deeply bound. Her characterization of this as 'a ghost in the digital machine' was very interesting.

Louis Chude-Sokei follows a similar message as McPherson in “The Uncanny History of Minstrels and Machines." The entire idea of relating black people to machines, beyond the obvious attempts at dehumanization, was that a 'perfect slave' would be one who did their masters every bidding to perfection with no trouble or complaint. In essence, the ideal slave was one that was a machine, not a human. 
## Reflection
Throughout class, we've discussed the importance of social media towards furthering social justice goals. Social media is a powerful tool in these modern times, and when wielded correctly, can allow m=for much to be accomplished. What Stephen says about BLM organizers being at the center of a social media web, with thousands tweeting at them and passing information along the thread, is the essence of how social media helps combat injustice. 
## Expand
Drawing off the article Sam Sander wrote, I'd like to address the fact that the article he addresses is written by an Indian guy. Racism and anti-blackness are sadly very prevalent in South Asian society, partially due to colonization, and many people of this descent do still view black people as 'others'. To go with that, and how the proliferation of the n-word on social media has increased, I would like to add this article. Specifically, this is directed towards the Desi guys I grew up with, and the far more of them that exist around the country, who have rarely had to deal with as much racism as their black friends but like to assume that since they are also a minority that they can use such language.

##Comment
Commenting on JB's lab lob from week 3, what he says about Pitt in contrast to Megan's log was an interesting point to read. I think I am more in favor with JB's point of view that Pitt is a self-assumed white savior. 
##Questions
* If technology has been built with racism embedded in it, what would be the first practical steps towards changing the way or technological systems work?
* Is it safe to say that going to the extent of believing that black people are 'machines' is no longer a prevalent narrative, and it has scaled back to now viewing black people as just 'the other'?
* From what I understood, BLM is planning a new way of attacking the racial struggles in this country. Has anything regarding that plan occurred yet?
