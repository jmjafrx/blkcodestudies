## Lab Log #5 | Channing Kimble-Brown

### Overview

**The Last Angel of History**

* This documentary showed a lot of black people from various fields discussing black music and black media. The narrative presented scifi/fantasty writers, musicians, scifi actors, a real life astronaut, and they all spoke about how black culture has always had a connection to technology and a fascination with space and the future because of our experiences. They talked at length about how black science fiction was a way to process the African American experience of being treated like an alien species in the US and having a feeling of displacement, longing for another planet to come home. Throughout the film the narrator spoke of a Data Thief, listeners and consumers of black music, peering at black culture through all of these forms of media and how that affected this thief by removing them from their present as they gained access to the past. 

**"Untimely Medi"**

* Kodwo Eshun focuses on the Black Audio Film Collective (BAFC) throughout this work. In a time where black artists seemed eager to deracialize their work in a world where blackness was hypervisible and constantly being consumed by non-black people, BAFC embraced this reality and emphasized blackness. BAFC aimed to decolonize thought and history and did so by disrupting pop culture with the radical idea that black imagination was prominent and essential in European modernity. Eshun discusses how several artists in various mediums, especially in sound, have created works that make discourse about different issues possible. 

**"Black Ontology Now: Dark Matters and Meeting the Lady Gaga Challenge"**

* In this piece Greg Tate covers a variety of topics pertaining to black music, visual art and performance and how each medium lends itself to changing the world and expressing black identity and thought. He descibes black American music specifically as the only accurate representation of black intellectual and emotional history that we have today, which he refers to as Dark Energy. Performance has always been inextricably linked to blackness in the Americas whether it was forcing black people to perform as they were guided to the auction block with music or chose to outdance their white slave masters. He brings up this idea of the Lady Gaga Challenge which seems to refer to outdoing Lady Gaga by aiming as high as possible (aspiring assert the importance and existence black humanity and creativity) while going low (achieving that goal using vulgarity or violence). He compares black music to black visual art, saying that music has the upperhand because it transcends logical processing and moves people without needing explanation, all with the bonus have mobility that doesn't require white instituations to thrive. He wraps up the piece saying that black music in the face of visual denial, black people have fought to establish our presence in the world of sound.

**"Sally Hemmings Dreams Zine"**

*  This Tumblr blog selling a Zine that contains a collection of poetry meant to explore the minds of women descended from slaves of African descent in the Americas. The blog contains a list of contributers, some poems and two audio samples. The blog itself has a very interesting layout that transitions between 8 elaborate backgrounds as you scroll down.

### Reflection

Each of these readings celebrated the power of black creativity and artistic expression in the interest of exploring blackness and the history of the African diaspora. The documentary, Kodwo Eshun and Greg Tate all discussed the cultural impact of black art on America and the rest of the world. They seem to suggest that sound and visuals are important tools that can and should be used by black people to fully undestand the past and the present. The documentary in particular also explored how science fiction and various music genres (techno, funk, jazz, etc.) inspire black people to dream about the future and aspire to search through space in an effort to assuage our feelings of displacement here on earth. The Sally Hemmings Deam Zine is interesting because its advertisement at least seems to be more interested in the introspection of black women in connection to more earthly and natural phenomena since they chose to feature audio of cicadas and storms and each of the backgrounds feature the sky and nature.

In regards to Beyonce's _Lemonade_ I specifically want to reference the visual album that she dropped on us without warning last year. A lot of the reading references black artists expressing themselves through visual and aural mediums to expose the inner self of black people. I feel like this visual album embodies everything that they talked about, from embracing blackness in a culture where blackness is hypervisible to relfecting the thoughts, lives and imaginations of our ancestors in all of the imagery woven throughout the album, referencing goddesses and real life events. The sound alone is moving, bridging each song with poetry by Warsan Shire, and even for many people that weren't black women, the entire experience was a moving one.

### Comment

In reference to Turquoise's first question about Afrofuturism, I have personally heard the term before but I never really knew what exactly it was referring to or how much history was behind it. I didn't even know that Detroit techno was a thing before watching the documentary. I wonder if this speaks to widespread cultural acceptance of Afrofuturism or if my ignorance is more a reflection of my parents' taste in music and what they chose to play while I was growing up.

### Question
0. Are there any ways in which black visual art has achieved more than black music? Is it really fair to compare the two mediums or are they kind of apples and oranges?
0. What did the glasses and the black box that appeared throughout the documentary mean?
0. Why is it called the Lady Gaga Challenge? Surely there are artists before that have resorted to shock value or vulgarity to make a larger point.
