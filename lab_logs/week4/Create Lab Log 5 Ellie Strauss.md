#**Lab Log 5: Afro Techno, 1880 Rappers, New and Old Film, and the Lady Gaga Challenge: Black Expression in the Media**#
####Ellie Strauss


##Overview 
*The Last Angel of History*

This film addresses the development of Atrofuturism during the 80s and 90s, and how this music provided a form of expression for Black musicians fascinated by space and a way to understand the future in the context of the past. Musicians working around the same time shared similar ideas, using space iconography and extraterrestiality to understand the role of Blacks within a larger American society. Various interviewees throughout the film, including George Clinton, the Black astronaut, DJ Snoopy, and various authors and historians likened science fictions narratives portraying someone who feels culturally dislocated and alienated to Black experiences in society during this time, and how techno music incorporating space and UFO sounds served as a integral form of expression. They explain how this music and movement allowed them to imagine the future while understanding their place in the present. The “data thief” character seen and referenced throughout the film serves as a personification of the desire to combine the fragments of information we have and with it crack the enigma or the code of what it all means to access the future. But this is a much more daunting task than it sounds, and so “confused, the data thief returns to the future” because history is mystifying, disorienting, and is easier left in its unexplained fragments. Just like these concepts and the “data thief,” many of the scenes throughout The Last Angel of History are trippy, disorienting, and prove difficult to explain. 


*Sally Hemings Dreams* 

This tumblr site, titled “Sally Hemings Dreams: A Collaborative Zine and Multimedia Portal” is a complications of original songs combining female voices and sounds, often through songs incorporating what could be slaves voices and music that gets increasingly agitated and concerning. “The Storm” begins with faint female voices repeating incomprehensible words, and ends with a series of “Ohs,” with a frantic musical interlude in between. In the other track, sounds of insects buzz loudly throughout, and in the back one can hear what sounds like a birdcall or some sort of “wah” sound repeated twice. Scrolling between the two tracks, you see a repeated picture of insects, a quote about dreams, and digging for truth while working. These two tracks are meant to combine the “conscious and unconscious” thoughts African Americans experienced in America as slaves, from the songs they sing to the buzz of insects constantly heard throughout the day. 


*Black Ontology Now: Dark Matters and Meeting the Lady Gaga Challenge,* Greg Tate 

In Black Ontology Now: Dark Matters and Meeting the Lady Gaga Challenge, Greg Tate explains the important role that music and visual arts play in providing an identity and form of expression for Blacks in America. Americans, but Black Americans in particular, feel this pressure to succeed and perform in a unique, new form that outdoes Lady Gaga’s extravaganzas. He argues that the best way to understand the sentiment of Blacks at a particular time is to look at the music they are creating, and to appreciate the visual art of the time even though these artists may be lesser known than the musicians. Hymns written in the early 1800s with the founding of the first African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philly and raps written to accompany lynchings are more informative than narratives according to Tate. He sees Black thought and consciousness articulated in Black music and art embodies the Dark energy, the most powerful force in nature that doesn’t interact with any masses of the universe. He explains the lively, unpredictable happenings and bustle of the streets of Harlem as a symbol of Black culture as a whole: this rich, dark energy finding unique forms of expression. 


*Untimely Medi,* Kodwo Eshun 

This article discusses Handsworth Songs at Documenta11, the movie that introduced people to the Black Audio Film Collective and made them appreciate Black filmmaking that was previously neglected and overshadowing by more commonly known and celebrated Young Black Artists. Black Film Audio Collection tries to remind people of the racialization and identification that is overshadowed by black artists trying to fit in, and to challenge this “new idea” of wanting to rewrite histories, when Blacks have been wanting to rewrite this histories for far too long. After struggling for a time in the 90s to stay open and successful compared to other groups that produced multi-media films, BFAC embraced their old school and public approach to inspire an independent film movement that challenged norms in American and European arts. BFAC disturbed much of the White film community at first who felt uncomfortable watching the realness of these stories being displayed on film. These types of films aim to use the past information to inspire new occurrences and change, creating a “new image of politics” not touched or attempted by BFAC’s contemporaries.     


##Reflection 

This session’s articles take a different approach to understanding how Blacks use arts from how we studied their Twitter use. Black artists see music as a particularly powerful form of expression, and this tendency of Blacks to identify with music can be traced back to the time of slave songs. I thought it was fascinating how Greg Tate explained the common sentiment among Blacks to “perform” and stand out. It is true that when looking at the most famous actors, artists, and writers today, there tend to be fewer Blacks than Whites. But this is not to say that Black actors, artists, and writers aren’t out there creating great work; it is just that they do not tend to get the same acclaim and attention that Whites doing the same things do. 
I had never thought about the link between techno music and science fiction, but I think it is a fascinating one. Especially when one of the interviewees in The Last Angel of History, I saw the link between the two very clearly: both groups feel apart from the norm and reality. This set of readings highlights the many forms of media that Blacks have identified as a form of expression, and it is fascinating to compare these practices to their use of Twitter described in the Sam Sanders NPR article. When perceiving oneself as an outsider similar to how a character in a Science Fiction novel or movie feels, it is fascinating to track how they find expression in Afrofuturism in Detroit, a city that combines the old America (the rustbelt from the Automobile industry) to the new one (Afrofuturism, funk, and Black music.)

These articles reminded me of the thriving Motown scene in Detroit in the 1960s. Many groups like the Four Tops were asked to “clean up their image” to appeal to the White audiences. They danced in an “appropriate manner” and dressed in refined, often white outfits. 


##Questions 

1.	How can we understand Sally Hemings Dream and the Last Angel of History together, both forms of auditory expressions created by Black artists, but with much different styles and intentions? 
2.	What exactly was the BFAC trying to do that was so controversial compared to other producers, besides the fact that they told the true histories in a new form of media instead of making them less harsh and coming up with new stories? 
3.	As the time when the first Black astronauts were flying into space, was this a monumental feat for the Astronomy field to feel confident in their abilities and capabilities to work well with the team?
