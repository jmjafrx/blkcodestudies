# Summary 
* "Untimely" by Kodwo Eshun
In this article Eshun writes about the Black Audio Film Collective, a groundbreaking British film collective. In the article, Eshun credits BAFC for introducing the practice of revisionary archeology in British cinema. Eshun loosely defines revisionary archeology as "a counter dimension of historical identification and affective resonance". Through the discussion of  Handworth Songs, Eshun reveals that revisionary archeology allows the audience to question historical perspectives around colonialism and question the true meaning of post colonialism. Eshun states that BAFC successfully uses this method by breaking traditional cinematic practices and use real documentary footage instead of stage actors, and emphasize the "nuance and gesture over character" in their cinemas. Instead of a representing colonialism through fictive dramatization, BAFC produce raw, documentary style cinemas that are focused on the concepts. Eshun argues that BAFC's work is groundbreaking because it produced a culture and discourse around post colonialism that was previously non existent and the works of BAFC law foundation for academic and theoretical development of postcolonial theory within the university. 

* "Black Ontology Now: Dark Matters and Meeting the Lady Gaga Challenge" Greg Tate
Greg Tate starts this article by stating that the only "accurate intellectual and emotional" history of Black America is reflected through Black American music. He argues that blues and jazz transcend the scope of music, instead is a reflection of the pain and suffering, and the experience of being black in America. In this way music is a true representation of black history in America because it exposes the raw emotions of artists like Nina Simone and Miles Davis that is often absent from other mediums of art like novels and plays. Tate then uses this interpretation of music as pain and suffering to link it to theories of dark matter; he argues that black music is dark matter because while we cannot provide observational evidence of its existence, it is a powerful force that contributes to the formation of a specific culture. Tate then argues that in the status quo visual art is a reflection of black history because, similar to jazz and blues, it reflects the artists emotions of being black in America. He criticizes the music industry by stating that black music is too mainstreamed and warns us against the dangers of mainstreaming black music, specifically how gangsta rap produces a spectacle of black violence for white audiences to enjoy, and how it closely mirrors the normalizations of  lynching as a family event in the early 20th century. 

* Jamilah Felton and Jess Solomon, "Sally Hemmings Dreams Zine"
I really liked the second audio piece titled "Listen", especially the earthy tones and vibes it produced. After listening to the piece, I noticed that there was a sentence above it that read "The freedom found in dreams is never enough". I am not sure if it is supposed to relate to the audio piece but I assume it is. The way I interpreted it was that the the "freedom" the audio provides is being out in nature which is tangible and real, and something that can be achieved beyond ones dreams.  

# Reflection
* Both Tate and Eshun's article were quite theoretical and at times quite difficult to read. However, I enjoyed the structure of both articles as it shifted from discussing the specificity of works of arts to theoretical discussions about art and its role in culture. Tate's point about visual artists desire for validation struck out to me the most. In the article artist Torkwase Dyson poses a question to Tate along the lines of why black visual artists are not as successful as black musical artists. While Tate provides numerous answers, the one that struck out to me was in order for black visual artists to become "popular" they need to get their works in places like the Whitney and MoMA, which are art establishments largely controlled by white people. Through this example, I think Tate makes a subtle commentary on art in contemporary society that we cannot simply determine success and the significance of works of art based on the opinions of white people. If we look at the #OscarsSoWhite and Beyonce's Grammy snubs, while many people were outraged, there was a small group of individuals who were expecting her to lose because of who votes for these awards (RE mostly middle age white men). I recently read Frank Ocean's tumblr post where he stated that he did not submit his album Blonde for any Grammys because he did not feel that the Grammys determined the success of his album or his artistry. I think more artists can benefit from the approach Frank took because it gives the artist power to define their artistry and not allow white institutions to label them as "success" or "failures"

# Expand
* After reading Eshun's piece of how BAFC introduced new techniques for film, I thought about the documentary Paris is Burning. The documentary is about queer culture in NYC during the late 1980's and 1990's. I really enjoyed the documentary because it provided a raw, organic outlook on queer life and queer individuals without ever feeling like it was scripted-only if "reality" tv of today could use these techniques. 

# Comment
* I am answering Jack's question (3) from week 4 lablog (1). 
I think post twitter, activities/activism spreads to local communities. I think one benefit of using social media is that it connects link minded people and allows me to be informed about resources, organizations that they can be part of within their community. In Baltimore after the uprisings, many of my friends used social media to contact organizations and worked for them. I think this is the most effective way that we can continue to be active in producing change once the hype of social media disappears.

# Questions
1. Tate's article was written a few years back, do you think his criticism of black music being too mainstream still applies given the release of albums by Kendrick, Beyonce and Solange?
2. After reading Tate's article, what do you think the Lady Gaga challenge is?
3. Given the current political climate, do artists have a responsibility to forgo monetary benefits to produce works of art that provide a social message?
