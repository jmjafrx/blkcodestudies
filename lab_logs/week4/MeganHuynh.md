# OVERVIEW:
This week’s reading was about how slavery and the portrayal of the black race has developed alongside the idea of machinery and machines. The articles “The Uncanny History of Minstrels and Machines” and “UNIX Machines” discuss how these relationships developed. The article about Black People using Twitter explained how people tend to make “something out of nothing” and automatically view Black activity as interesting, abnormal, or unique. Secondly, the article acknowledges how the response to the original article showcased how people used re-photoshopping the “Black” Twitter bird as a form of activism that was incredible powerful in countering “damaging media.” Lastly, the Wired article about How the Black Lives Matter movement uses social media explained how mass media and modern technology has shaped the movement in contrast to the Civil Rights movement. Social media has become a source for “raw, live information” that can help motivate activism. There have been downsides to mass media, in that there is high surveillance and the anonymity of the internet can mask the racism that underlies America’s culture. Overall, technology reshaped how the Black Lives Movement differs from the Civil Rights Movement, yet in some way seems to reassert similar struggles. 
# REFLECTION:
The article about “How Black People Use Twitter” resonated with me in that I see and hear this type of bewilderment even amongst my peers. I agree that in many ways Black people’s behaviors seem to be more unique or exotic than if a White person were to do the exact same thing. Personally, I do feel a certain separation between the Black community on campus versus the rest of the student body. They appear to be more unified, more active, more involved, more dynamic, and more concerned. From an outsider looking in, I can relate to the original author in thinking that Black people have a certain vibe about them that can make something popular or mainstream. I suppose this is similar to the way music has been a place where Black artists dominate. Fans praise Beyonce for her grace, activism, and powerful voice. Therefore, for other Black artists like Kanye West, Chance the Rapper, or John Legend – their work and music can be deemed genius purely because they’re a Black artist.

This weekend I recently visited Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. While walking through the streets of the theme park, I saw this sign – Selma Ave. I thought this was interesting because Selma, itself, is not a popular area. The street was in an area that did not seem to be Southern themed or related to the Civil Rights Movement. I realized after looking at the park map that the daily parades start and end at Selma Ave. I may be reading too much into the significance of this, but I speculate that this was no coincidence and that the parade symbolizes the march from Selma to Montgomery that led to the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
# COMMENT:
Response to Helen’s Expansion post: I agree that American slavery is incredibly unique in the fact that race was the overall divider between master and slave. She mentioned that slavery wasn’t banned until the late 1800s/early 1900s – because the nation is highly homogenous, has it made it easier for ex-slaves to reintegrate into society without judgement and tension? Or, can people spot out who was a slave and who wasn’t? 
# QUESTION:
*	The reading about machinery and racism are written in this decade. I feel that this discussion relating slaves to machines overstretches what the real perception of slaves was during that day. Is this sentiment actually widespread? Do many people believe that there is a correlation?
*	Why has there been an emphasis on mainstream vs. Black in media? For example, why is there a mainstream Twitter space and a Black Twitter. Does that imply that it is Blacks against every other race on the internet?
*	Unlike the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Lives Matter movement does not seem to have a definitive end. The Civil Rights Movement culminated with the gaining of Voting and other legal rights for Blacks. However, how will BLM know it’s end?
