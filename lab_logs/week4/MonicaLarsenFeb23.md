## Overview
### The Last Angel of History
This short film conceptualizes issues of afrofuturism by drawing ties to afrodiasporic traditions and culture. Throughout the movie, black music culture and roots play a distinct role in tracing the data theif's voyage through time and space. The data theif's journey's goal is to find and collect pieces of history to complete his future. The film is a combination of fiction and documentary, which shows real video footage and pictures as well as audio clips from prominent figures through history.
### Eshun, Kodwo, "Untimely Meditations: Reflections on the Black Audio. Film Collective," Nka Journal of Contemporary African Art, 2004. 
Eshun focuses on the Black Audio Film Collective and how it changed the film industry in the United Kingdom. Instead of trying to make film work less racial, like other film companies, the BAFC instead chose to emphasize and highlight blackness. The goal is to represent blackness in a way that it is not represented by other films that fetishize black bodies and choose aspects of blackness to showcase in a "non-racial" racist way. 
### Tate, Greg, "Black Ontology Now: Dark Matters and Meeting the Lady Gaga Challenge" Black Renaissance Noire, Spring 2011 
Tate uses his platform to argue that there is no separation between black culture and black music culture because that is how black people have been commodified since they were first stolen into slavery. Black music has been seen as a commodity and Tate assesses why black visual arts have not been nearly as popular or well known. He ends the piece with a comparison between Brooklyn and Harlem and also uses lyrical style of writing to emphasize black music and the way it is looped into everything that is culturally black.
### Jamilah Felton and Jess Solomon, "Sally Hemmings Dreams Zine" 2015
This Tumblr page is meant to archive and collect the thoughts of women of African descent who were forced into slavery in the Americas. The page is laid out to highlight both conscious and unconscious thoughts, ideas, and imagination of these women in a place where their ideas matter the most, as opposed to traditionally white, male dominated spaces. It is a multimedia platform to showcase these women and their often overlooked and unremembered lives and experiences. The Tumblr layout makes it easy to scroll through the pages seamlessly. 
## Reflection
The readings, movie, and tumblr page all highlight how slavery has tied into the way that black individuals are perceived today in terms of culture. The main emphasis is on music and how to reclaim this idea of black culture as music, using fugitivity and digital archives. The fugitivity can be linked to the commodification and fetishization of black bodies, whether it be music or depiction in films and visual media.

This picture is just really cute and reminds me of how important it is for children to see characters in movies, shows, books, etc. who look like them and embrace their natural selves. 
## Comment
In response to JB, "Will there ever be a moment in music where Black sorrow is no longer profitable? What societal forces could produce such a change?", I don't know if there will ever be a moment in music where Black sorrow is no longer profitable because music wants real stories and many of these stories are not happy, whether they come from a black or white or brown individual. 
## Question
* How can musicians and athletes help stop the commodification of black bodies?
* Why have black visual art forms been ignored, while black music has been commodified?
* How can afrofuturism retrace history to rewrite the parts that were skewed by white history?
