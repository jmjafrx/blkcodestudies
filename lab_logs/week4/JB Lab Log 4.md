 “How Black Lives Matter Uses Social Media to Fight the Power”

In this article, readers are introduced to a great discussion on the parallels of how civil rights activists of the 1960s and contemporary moments used media to disseminate information. During the campaign against Jim Crow in the 1960s, civil rights workers used WATS reports as real time accounts of violence against Black activists and their allies to share these incidents with a larger audience, but mainly press. More specifically, civil rights workers took advantage of a budding technology, television that was becoming more mainstream. Stephen wrote that it was evening news broadcasts and the television crews that captured these horrific offenses that allowed for these civil rights incidents to go unnoticed. Television captured the brutality that civil rights workers faced, which brought the Black freedom struggle to a larger audience. Contemporary activists are more cognizant of ways to dissemination information. Unlike their 1960s counterparts, 21st century activists are not limited to one media forum (television) to mobilize a resistance movement. While such a phenomenon may seem helpful, some observers of the Black Lives Matter Movement cite this decentralization (in both information and organizational structure) as a concern for the sustainability of the movement. Further, observers took notice to an increase anonymous racists who use the internet to harass activists.

“All Things Considered”

In this article, Sam Sanders examines a variety of debates on how Black people use twitter. His article was written in response to Farhad Manjoo’s, a Slate columnist, article titled “How Black People Use Twitter.” This article offers an analysis of Manjoo’s examination of Black Twitter, but also offers a series of critiques of such a one-dimensional view of Black social media use. Manjoo wanted to know why the most popular Twitter hashtags or trends were started by Twitter uses of color. He admitted that he did not have any Black teenage friends, but still had an interest in understanding how Black twitter operated. One critic of Manjoo’s article claimed that his findings were reminiscent of voyeurism, someone who wants a pick into the society that are writing on without full inclusion into it. Further, Danielle Belton argued against creating a monolithic characteristic for all Black Twitter users. Another interesting critique of Manjoo’s comments were found not in written protest, but in the appropriation of his problematic Twitter bird. Instead sporting a cocked “fitted” (basketball cap), the bird sports more accurate representation of the black experience. 

Greenberg Article

Essentially, Twitter is a mess and that may be an understatement. Internally, the social media site faces a power struggle such as the executive turnovers within the last year. For Twitter’s investors, the market has not been kind to them. The platform’s stocks have plummeted leaving investors a financial watchers wary of Twitter’s long term sustainability. And although Twitter has become a repository for dissemination information, it has become a hotspot for harassment, threats against users. Most recently, Twitter has become the medium the occupant of the White House uses to communicate his varied irrationalities with the American public. 

McPherson Article

Tara McPherson takes an unconventional approach by the histories of computer innovations with race. Her central argument opposes the lenticular view of history, a view that only recognizes a discrete way or one view of events. She found that both tech historians and race scholars fail to acknowledge the importance of the other’s history. McPherson placed her convergence of these histories on two central moments in the 1960s. First, she examined the development of UNIX, one of the earliest operating systems for computers. She contrasted this innovation with more well-known incidents of anti-Black violence during the Black liberation movement of the 1960s. To prevent such lenticular views of history, historians should present a stereoscope approach, which focuses overall instead of the fragmented lenticular approach. Further, McPherson tackled the issue of modularity in technology and social history. Modularity is linked to simplicity and related to code that can be constructed and recombined. McPherson linked this ideology with race and the move toward neoliberal race politics and history. 

Sokei Article

In this article, Louis Sokei traced the near century long pop culture phenomenon of minstrels. He started his discussion referencing Joice Heth, a slave of a claimed advanced age purchased by circus king P.T. Barnum. Barnum showcased Heth as a mammy figure, calling her “Aunty Joice”, “Venerable Nigger” and “The Greatest Natural and National Curiosity.” Heth became the first incarnation of the Mammy caricatured that dominated American culture for several generations. Sokei mentioned how American pop culture used the Barnum model to create the minstrel characters Sambo and Jim Crow. These grotesque imaginings of the Black Americans revealed the desire of white racists to portray Blacks as bestial creatures, incapable of civility and humanity. These dehumanizing depictions correlated with a rise in race literature that glamorized white supremacy. These fictional depictions of Blacks convinced some whites that they could both fear Black Americans, but also treat them with contempt and harshly because of a perceived lack of humanity.

**Reflection**:
 
I would have not willingly read McPherson’s article. Her discussion of tech history was a bit boring to me and I found myself rushing to get through her mentioning of tech in the article. However, I thought her parallels between tech and race were interesting examples that she argued well. I thought the author of “How Black Lives Matter Uses Social Media” referenced DeRay McKesson way too often. I do not know if the author contact Alicia Garza, but reading her perspective would have been more appropriate. Alicia started the hashtag and I think is not given enough coverage outside of certain circles. I am also not the biggest fan of DeRay.

I am not a cigarette smoker. I have asthma, so smoking cigarettes would not be advantageous for my lung health. However, I appreciate that woman’s aesthetic. She is standing there smoking what I hope is a Virginia Slim (fits with the storyline I created for her) loosie in front of those troopers. I am just in awe.

**Questions**:

* Is there any way to regulate hate speech on Twitter and then have consequence for such hate rhetoric?

* What are some of the challenges with having a decentralized movement? In terms of communicating, what does a variety of messaging and lack of core message do to a movement’s sustainability?

* Are there examples in media today of minstrel characters? Can we consider the token Black characters in films, television and theater, specifically the comic relief characters, examples of 21st century minstrels?
