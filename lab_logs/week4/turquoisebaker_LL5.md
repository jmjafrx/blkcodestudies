### Overview

Tate, Greg, "Black Ontology Now: Dark Matters and Meeting the Lady Gaga Challenge" Black Renaissance Noire) 

- In this piece, Greg Tate studies “Black Visions versus Black Visuality” (6). He begins with the claim that music holds more intellectual and emotional history of Black America than any other document by white colonizers, and continues by addressing the commodification of pain in the Black music: “Trauma is a muscle and if you want to be an Aristocrat you gotta work it out routinely” (9). As for why music has been such a successful medium to spreading the Black experience throughout America, Tate suggests that it is related to rhythm and Dark Energy, which have the capacity to reach the heart and soul faster and more efficiently than visual art. The work is concluded by denoting Harlem as a place where the Dark Energy, Rhythm, vision, pain, and experience gather: a community that manifests the “kulcha we call black” (15). 

The Last Angel of History (film)

- The Last Angel of History is a film seeking to explore and emphasize the significance of Afrofuturism (primarily in Europe and America) in various mediums. Interspersed between scenes of the “Data Thief”, flashing blue lights, and strobed images of insect drawings and mathematical equations, the audience hears from an array of influential black figures in music, film, science, and literature. Juan Atkins, a techno musician, says that he wants to “perpetuate the technological future to music”, and used the synthesizer to add a futuristic element to his music. Samuel R. Delany, renowned science fiction novelist, stated that the genre “offers a significant distortion of the present”. Kodwo Eshun, a  Afrofuturism critic, notes that the “alien” narrative in science fiction stories is a narrative all too familiar to black people all over the world: They were “abducted” from their homes, became the object of genetic alteration and more. The history of the black experience especially in the past few centuries is ultimately a reflection if not blueprint for the science fiction movement and even Afrofuturism. 

Eshun, Kodwo, "Untimely Medi" Nka Journal of Contemporary African Art 

- In “Untimely Medi”, Kodwo Eshun looks at the works of the Black Audio Film Collective (BAFC), and how they thrived during an era obsessed with marketing the fetishization of blackness and black culture. Breaking free of this global market required black artists in the 80s and 90s to take a new approach to filmmaking. Individuals like Steve McQueen and Kara Walker changed their aesthetic, with “mute or evasive positioning” strategies (39). Eshun uses the film, *Who Needs A Heart*, as an example throughout the piece. Unlike various other films of its time, *Who Needs A Heart*, verbally silenced the characters and replaced the words with music. Therefore, the music actively moves the piece, and the piece “mocks motivation and ironizes explanation” (44).

Jamilah Felton and Jess Solomon, "Sally Hemmings Dreams Zine" 2015 

- “Sally Hemmings Dreams Zine” is a collaborative Zine focused on exploring the thoughts “women of African descent who experienced slavery in the Americas”. A Zine, according to dictionary.com, is a “fanzine” (a magazine produced fans). The Tumblr page has a link to Etsy, where one can see images of the physical item, which is handmade. Proceeds from the Zine go to Thrive DC’s Women in New Directions Program (WIND), to help women successful rejoin their communities after incarceration [(TheBeatofBlossoms, Etsy)](https://www.etsy.com/listing/470832145/sally-hemings-dreams-zine-collaborative?ref=listing-shop-header-0).  

### Reflection

- Being completely honest, today’s readings were the most difficult for me to understand out of all the readings we have read so far. In part, I think my confusion stemmed from the unique writing styles of people like Greg Tate, whose work (albeit brilliant) keeps you on your toes, going from “Git low” to “metonymically” in the blink of an eye. However, I think my difficulty understanding these readings and the film are ultimately become of  my unfamiliarity with Afrofuturism. I grew up with groups like Funkadelic and Parliament (my dad is a huge fan) but I never understood their music as “revolutionary” or “inconceivable” for the time. I just thought the synthesizers sounded cool. Strides towards liberation and freedom and unhinged unapologetic expression for the black community, nationally and internationally, takes different forms, and I look forward to further understanding visual and auditory mediums that created this revolutionary form of expression. 

### Expand

- This was actually one of my favorite songs my dad played as a kid for me. I literally never recognized the futuristic funk vibes as a part of a greater movement. The song is *Flashlight* by Parliament.

### Comment

- @Zsattar, Lab Log 5: I really like that image you posted in your “Expand” section. When I was looking at album covers of groups like Parliament, Funkadelic and the Ohio Players (mostly on Spotify) I found many similarities. Many had a very “intergalactic” vibe, with bright colors, and often provocative images. They were anything but minimalist. I’d be interested to look into the role of album covers in the 70s, 80s and 90s in the Afrofuturism movement. 
  
### Questions 

- Did you know about Afrofuturism before this week? Are there any other aspects of Black culture (music, visual, literary etc.) that you perhaps took for granted, or did not recognize as a part of a greater movement?
- Who is the Data Thief? 
- Going against the grain seems to be a recurring theme in Black culture and Black movements (ex: being thought as an enigma between “non-human”, slave and robot, yet embracing a futuristic medium). In our day and age, is there a way to go against the grain, and reconstruct oppressive thought and mediums to benefit and contribute to the diverse world of Black culture?
