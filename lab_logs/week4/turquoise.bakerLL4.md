### Overview

“On Its 10th Birthday, a Short History of Twitter in Tweets | WIRED.”

- Julia Greenberg’s article, written on March 21, 2016, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the global social media platform, Twitter, with a history told in tweets. Through her delineation of Twitter milestones, from the first tweet by “jack” (Jack Dorsey) in 2006, to Jeb Bush’s depressingly hilarious “Sorry Mom” tweet upon his performance in the 2016 Election, readers can see how much of an impact Twitter has had on the world, and how quickly it has spread. Twitter has been instrumental in social movements around the world, such the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street. However, Twitter’s diversity and easy accessibility, Greenberg notes, makes it “the world’s biggest cocktail party”, and sometimes “a mess”. To be successful on this platform, one has to echo the loudest in world’s largest echo chamber, in only 140 characters. 

Sanders, Sam. “How Black People May Or May Not Use Twitter.” 2010 NPR.org

- This is a rough transcript of an interview between Sam Sanders of NPR’s All Things Considered and Farhad Manjoo, author of the article, “How Black People Use Twitter”. Manjoo sought to figure out why so many hashtags came from black youth. He concluded that black youth use the platform differently than others. Many found his article offensive, and it soon had a huge amount of backlash. Baratunde Thurston, comedian and blogger, claimed that Twitter’s black youth were not doing anything different than “40-year-old white male technologists”. Danielle Belton of blacksnob.com also refuted Manjoo, “There’s no special racialized way of skateboarding or riding a bike, and that’s the same way it is with Twitter”. The illustrations of the brown Twitter bird with accompanied the article also angered various users. Manjoo, however, says it was a form of “reasserting a claim to [one’s] own identity”.

“How Black Lives Matter Uses Social Media to Fight the Power.” WIRED. 2015. 

- In the 1960s, civil rights activist living in the “Jim Crow South” faced many difficulties when spreading news to the rest of the world. Initial information would have to be communicated by phone to other major workers or through activist organizations. Now, Philip Montgomery, author of this article, states, social media platforms can facilitate precise, instantaneous communication, making Black movements in America much more visible. Unfortunately, these platforms can also result in a concentration of hate abuse. Even if these digital threats, slurs and attacks proliferate, especially by anonymous users, bystanders often fail to take them seriously. In spite of this, social movements and campaigns, like Campaign Zero and #BlackLivesMatter, with the help of social media have contributed to the “removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capital” and investigation of police conduct in cities like Baltimore. The new real and raw technological approach has made “today’s struggle feel both different from and continuous with the civil rights era”. 

McPherson, Tara. “US Operating Systems at Mid-Century.” In Race after the Internet, edited by Lisa Nakamura and P Chow-White, 2013 

- Tara McPherson’s chapter “US Operating Systems at Mid-Century” serves to analyze and insist highlight the entanglement of race and UNIX, an operating system created in the 1960s. The creation of this platform, and other major events like the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. or Black Panthers are contemporaries. Finding the connection between these events is difficult, partly because of the “lenticular” way began to understand the world around us: by “privileging fragmentation” which in turn “suppresses relation and context” (25). 

- Coders began to value the detachment of programs which would simplify implementation and consequently the programs themselves. This was often denoted with the use of pipes in code languages (x). Socially, “rules of modularity” were used to “decrease ‘global complexity’” like with “Whites only” signs (30).

- McPherson is not insinuating that coders were not actively coding racial rhetoric, nor that we should start connecting race and topic X to find correlations. We should, however, critique our own knowledge practices and their potentially “modular” natures, and seek to understand the interactions between race and the internet. 

Chude-Sokei, Louis. “The Uncanny History of Minstrels and Machines, 1835-1923,” edited by Stephen Johnson, 104–32. Univ of Massachusetts Press.  

- Chude-Sokei begins this chapter with the story of Joice Heth, an allegedly 161 year old black woman bought by P. T. Barnum in 1835 and put on display in a room adjacent to “The Turk”, a chess-playing machine. “A Visitor” most likely Barnum or his associate, suggested Heth was a “not a human being” but “curiously-constructed automation made up of whalebone, India-rubber” and springs, controlled by an operator (109). The interactions of science and race became more apparent in the 20th century, the rise of jazz and swing music. New art forms like these were seen as “primitivist modernism” according to Chude-Sokei. Disturbing parodies of blacks with blackface and the increased popularity of this character, Sambo, served to normalize this way of thought, and the suggestion that blacks and the “African aesthetic” were distinct from the whites of Western culture and barely more human that “the Turk” or other machines (113). 

### Reflection

- I liked how this week’s readings required that we look more closely at the way blacks use the media in America and the media itself as an object of study. I found that Montgomery and Greenberg’s articles, which were either about, or briefly mentioned Twitter, illustrated the pros and cons of the next platform we will be using. Although it does wonders when it comes to organizing large groups of people, or starting a trend no one asked for but everyone wanted, Twitter is the world’s craziest melting pot. Anyone can say anything about anything. Therefore, the most important messages may get lost in the chaos. Perhaps Twitter is more for making a statement than it is sending a comprehensive message. (note: I created a Twitter months ago but have never used it). 

### Expand

- If you were so unfortunate (or fortunate, depending on how you look at it) that you did not see [Donald Trump’s solo press conference](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/02/16/trump-asks-a-black-reporter-to-set-up-a-meeting-with-black-members-of-congress/?utm_term=.76a7c9a2e360), then you may not have heard about his interaction with April Ryan, White House correspondent for the American Urban Radio Networks. April Ryan asked Donald Trump about how he would execute his plans to “fix the inner cities” as he campaigned. After “answering” her question by gloating about his own election statistics regarding women, Hispanics and blacks, Ryan follows up by asking if he will include the Congressional Black Caucus, and proceeds to ask her: “Do you wanna set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours?” 

- It turns out that the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) sent a [letter](http://cbc-richmond.house.gov/sites/congressionalblackcaucus.house.gov/files/2017-19-01%20CBC%20Letter%20to%20POTUS%20on%20New%20Deal.pdf) to Trump nearly a month ago (January 19, 2017) which addressed Trump’s “unproductive” campaign methods regarding the African American community and invited him to work with them in addressing the problems that affect the diverse African-American population. ![tweet](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7-Dnh2QVGYdHGu-nFt73A4SQneZ2XNsWi8oOyOpgwPFZfDxEWUk0q31ssOSdzSnimvgqJjs4yeDdilrMED4Qt7ktPM0xja84nzMMOEPwHY2m4DiwM0u1c8mJSBxtIT-p8V3vzQ4gKWLsUO_D0C0lHUdR9eIKJDD1GPTQ3e65UiRxzzBAHHGNTp_Jjx8dSMRhKBj3lrAuIhDEWwFT5jWxpObLagySz5OPglvEBNPelh_qxp0JG3-z2BJgvsanZropLC1CeGHwkwBt5HaGVqR21hXy9ktg0RsIQybvuqsgHENnkaGyd_gcZVTJ80nbR7dlWV8A-OtAegVT18J5sZnQ9RlthMabC138Hfa1C1sRvnvv4Hkwd2Syq4ghsuaBO7qIQGbPNxVcROkYY9rIbKVgu4DR1ouzCBwH1m5p5PPKnZolAUqfBMVixdqZzZoqYG8nAkrJwdrEoU-eqs5A0f8fePOwceYt-2KbZF5LrqCnwlKl1TirQq2uHlYA7I2KRRC_h0bioXb-0ksC8QkIIFfkjoQ5YR_RYyZ9LvfhaGMCSr0aSK3QKpDHZQz3xxGsiLfRsGVuIm5aBDeFpmL-FStgT8uPbvvMwFQrTRy2mrwCeiKy__vSViM=w632-h332-no) 

### Comment

- @ZSattar, LL3: I like your question about how to shift the focus away from the white body as a standard. Part of this can be done in promoting more multicultural fashion in America. This does not just mean having more races represented on the runway. We need to see more races represented on all mediums. Without this increase in exposure, beautiful and successful men and women of color continually be seen as anomalies and wayward dreams instead of feasible goals for millions of young people. 

### Question

- Is Twitter the best social media platform to create social change? Why or why not? 
- Tara McPherson presents us with a comprehensive argument on the connection between the UNIX operating system and race in the mid 20th century. Why should we care? 
- Are black youth really using Twitter differently than other races, or is the content posted by black youth more easily spread and parodied? Neither? Why or why not?
