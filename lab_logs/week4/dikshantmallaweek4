# Overview
* "How Black Lives Matter Uses Social Media to Fight the Power" by Bijan Stephen
In this article Stephen discusses the importance of social media in creating social change. He emphasizes how Black Lives Matter have been successful in using social media platforms like twitter and vine to spread real time information that has been crucial in sparking change. He also states that Black Lives Matter and social media have played an important role in defining what is means to be black in America. He gives an example of how black individuals feel compelled to record all police interactions, and how this is empowering because they are able to hold authorities accountable. However, he states that the over exposure to social media has also created numerous problems including online abuse and anonymous bashing. Stephens compares the Civil Rights moment to Black Lives Matter by stating that whereas the Civil Rights movement relied on core institutions to strengthen the movement, the use of social media has meant that movements are now more decentralized and not dependent on institutions.

* "How Black People May or May Not Use Twitter" by Sam Sanders
Sanders article is a response piece to the backlash received by the article "How Black People Use Twitter" by Slate columnist Farhad Manjoo. Sanders writes that people were upset by the article because it attempts to create a spectacle out of black youth for engaging on twitter, just like other individuals. 

* "On Its 10th Birthday, A Short History of Twitter in Tweets" by Julia Greenberg
This article is about celebrating twitters 10th birthday and it starts with a financial update on twitters recent struggle due to its slowed user growth rate. The collection of tweet ranges from its inception to the birth of the hashtag and @ replys. It also focuses on how twitter played a crucial role during the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street. 

* "U.S. Operating Systems at Mid-Century: The Interwining of Race and UNIX" by Tara McPherson 
McPherson takes an interesting approach by discussing two separate "fragments" that took hold during the 1960's: race and coding. She argues that concepts of modularity and covert computations, generally related to the field of coding and computers, can be applied to race relations post Civil Rights.Whereas racial inequalities prior to the Civil Rights were more overt, with Jim Crow's state sanctioned discrimination and bigotry, post Civil Rights era these inequalities have been more covert. Here she refers to neoliberalism and the social and economic immobility of black people in "deteriorating city centers" (RE: New Orleans post Katrina). McPherson's analogy is not an attempt to identify modularity as a source of racial inequalities, instead it is to emphasize the insidious ways modularity can be part of the social fabric of American life. McPherson's best example of modularity in American society is her discussion of the university and academia. She argues that starting with the 1980's there is a "depoliticization" of curricula in American universities. She lists practices such as the emphasis on texts over images and context, and nebulous creation of "study areas" where students are thought on the specificity of each subjects. She argues these are attempts of a "divide and conquer" strategy to detach students from understanding the social world around them. She ends by emphasizing that it is simply not enough to study ways in which digital technology reproduce inequality, instead it is important to study the source of that inequality (i.e. coding). She says that while it might be difficult to understand race through studying technical concepts of coding, it is important to always evoke the question of how what we learn fits within the larger practice of modularity. 


# Reflection
While reading Bijan Stephen's piece on social media and Black Lives Matter, I kept thinking about the concept of #Activism. From my understanding, #Activism is a criticism that using social media to post about social inequity does not actually accomplish anything, instead it simply gives people a false sense of belief that making a status makes them into an activist. The first time I was truly exposed to this was during the 2015 Baltimore uprisings.  During the Baltimore uprising many Hopkins students made statuses about their experiences living in Baltimore and their feelings towards the uprisings. To be honest, I was quite annoyed by these posts because many of the students  who were professing their love for Baltimore and how "sad" they were at the events taking place, were the same students who did not make an effort to explore Baltimore beyond Charles Village. I was also annoyed by these students because as soon as the "hype" of the uprising was over, they went back to their normal lives as if nothing had happened. I think this is a product of #Activism because many of these students felt that they made a change by making these "powerful" status yet they failed to question the systems that produced the conditions for the uprising. I think the Baltimore uprising was the first time I fully understood that to be an activist and create meaningful change requires individuals to be engaged within their communities and simply tweeting or making a facebook status does not contribute to that change. I think #Activism is dangerous because it promotes a culture of complacency. I think this is an extremely topical conversation with regards to the women's march. While everyone on social media and regular media are praising people for wearing pink hats, making clever signs and posting pictures in DC, it is important to remember that we cannot be complacent, that if we want to fight bigotry we must engage and work within our local communities and that work does not end by simply getting likes on a picture.

Thinking about #Activism and the Baltimore Uprisings, made me think about Baltimore United for Change, which is a coalition of grassroots organizations in the city that are working together to fight inequality in Baltimore. 

#Comment
I am answering Ellie's third question from week3 about the reconciliation between the black gaze and the white gaze. I think it is important to study about both the white gaze and the black gaze in the 19th century. First, I agree with the author that most artifacts from the 19th century are greatly influenced by the white gaze and it is important to find documents that are produced by black individuals because it provides a fresh, new perspective from ex-slaves that has been very limited up to date. Second, I think we ought to study material that is produced from the white gaze because it allows us to compare and contrast the perspective of plantation owners (and generally other white people) views of slavery and black people to perspectives of black individuals and how they viewed slavery and plantation life.

1. Can you think of an experience in university life where you felt the practice of modularity come to fruition?
2. How do you think we can better use social media as a platform to promote social change?
3. Do you think shareholders of twitter should be concerned about its stagnant user growth rate?
