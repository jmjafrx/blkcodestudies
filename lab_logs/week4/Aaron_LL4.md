Overview
--------

This week’s readings deal with the ways that blackness in America corresponds to, intertwines with, and parallels the rise of machines and technological trends from antebellum slavery to present day.

Reflection
----------

**“On Its 10th Birthday, a Short History of Twitter in Tweets”** by Greenburg is a short timeline of Twitter landmarks since its beginnings in 2006. Highlights include the introduction of the hashtag, Oprah’s first Twitter account. 

**“How Black People May Or May Not Use Twitter”** by Sam Sanders encapsulates a separate article that suggests that black Twitter users interact with the interface and each other in a unique way.  

**“How Black Lives Matter Uses Social Media to Fight the Power”** by Bijan Stephen touches on the evolution of communication from the Civil Rights Movement of the ‘60s to present day. The current structure similarly engages the media with powerful imagery to provoke the American public, but differs in that it lacks a formal institutional structure.

**“The Uncanny Mysteries of Minstrels and Machines”** by Chude-Sokei fleshes out the thingification and commodification of black people through minstrelsy and its relation what she calls a “machine aesthetic.”

**“U.S. Operating Systems at Mid-Century”** by McPherson places race in parallel to the development of UNIX and development techniques, focusing mostly on the use of modularity in systems of communication.

This past summer I witnessed social dissemination first-hand after I shared an account of my first run-in with a racist police officer in Virginia. I published it on Facebook and Medium, a social platform for long-form content. On Facebook I marked the incident as a “Life Event,” as it truly was, and somewhat ironically, as most Life Events people post are typically relationship statuses or job updates. I assume that the event demarcation also made it the post more prevalent on people’s news feeds. It was shared a bunch of times and some people contacted me asking for more details. I was happy to share my story because I believed that it, like the thousands of others, could change something.
Thinking of how the format would’ve been altered based on the platform is interesting. Using GroupMe, Instagram Live Video, or Twitter to report what was happening on the spot would have been frightening and potentially dangerous in the context of the situation. I would have published on Tumblr similarly to FB, but it is unlikely that anyone else could read about my experience.

To Megan’s question about the ends of the BLM movement, their website shows its guiding principles, which do indeed seem flexible to adapt to social and political changes over time. I think its a good thing that this movement is flexible enough to adapt to any issue or setting as it calls on the power of communities that it effects. I think this also speaks to Bijan Stephen’s point about lacking a singular voice. This movement is meant to outlast a generation, so that if our next Dr. King were to pass, it would not mark the end of his or her principles.

Question
--------

* How does modularity fit into other American systems like healthcare, real estate, etc.?
* What do you think of Black People Twitter? Should/could there be offshoots that cover a wider range of the black experience?
* Do you think BLM is as diffuse as it says in the Stephen article? In your own experience could you identify any signs of a structure within BLM?
