##Overview

This week's readings were about how technology has historically been linked with systemic racism (thingification, modularity, etc.) and how Black people are currently utilizing technology, specifically Twitter, to fight for their rights and advance a movement to push back against racism.

Tara McPherson's chapter on “US Operating Systems at Mid-Century” covers the development of UNIX, the first developed operating system, and how the developers began to strive for modularity, which has thus caused information to be compartmentalized. McPherson makes the link between this, which happened in the 1960s, and the way in which race was dealt with during and post-Civil Rights Movement. McPherson urges that "code studies" must be historicized and politicized for us to recreate a link between racial relations/race studies and computer science, engineering, etc.

Louis Chude-Sokei discusses how American popular culture was built on portraying African Americans post-abolition as robots and "things." Chude-Sokei draws upon the development of science fiction (robots gaining souls and enslaving their human masters... eerily parallel to white anxiety about freed slaves) and circus attractions Joice Heth, a slave, and the Turk, an automaton.  

Julia Greenberg gives an introduction and a brief history of Twitter as a company and a platform, and she shows the huge impact that Twitter has had in our wired society today. From the emergence of hashtags, to the birth and death of Vine, Twitter has changed the way we communicate and consume media forever.

Sam Sanders reflects upon the different implications of the controversial Slate article "How Black People Use Twitter," an analysis of why "Black Twitter" is unique in the Twitter universe. Many people were angry about the article presenting all African Americans as a monolith, but the original author, Farhad Manjoo, defends himself by saying that the Black youth is truly engaging in Twitter in an interesting way that no other group is.

In a photo journal style article, Bijan Stephen discusses the Black Lives Matter movement and its unique position in American history as a movement founded and pushed through social media, mostly Twitter. Stephen compares BLM to previous historical movements in its large scale and social influence, but also discusses the limitations/down sides of a social movement fueled by tweets, live videos, GroupMe, etc.

##Reflection

I thought Chude-Sokei's writings were fascinating but also somewhat sickening in understanding the roots of American popular culture. It also truly gave me a deeper understanding of the political implications between things like black face and mammy (Aunt Jemima) because of how truly engrained these cultural figures and phenomena are to the history of slavery and oppression. 

I was also especially impacted by the way Stephen said that, through social media, Twitter, the Internet, etc., Black people are being allowed to contextualize their experiences in a larger social pool, and are given words to describe their experiences with racism. I definitely felt this in high school when I was also angry and frustrated by the sexism I constantly faced, but it wasn't until I began reading about feminism on Tumblr that I was finally able to understand what made me so deeply angry. Tumblr gave me terms, definitions, and relatable content for me to understand and explain what I was going through, and I think if I had been on Twitter, I would've probably been opened up to even more.

I personally haven't ever had any direct experience on what has been dubbed "Black Twitter," but I have definitely read tons and tons of articles of "12 Best Hashtags from Black Twitter in 2015," "15 Best Clapbacks on Black Twitter" etc etc. Not only is it somewhat strange to realize that copying and pasting tweets into a "listicle" is now a news article, but it's really interesting to see just how much sheer news Black Twitter alone has generated. The news it covers is so so diverse (from tweets about Wiz Live, to comments on Trump, to funny memes), but it all somewhat gets categorized under Black Twitter. 

##Comment

@turquoise.bakerLL4: Whether or not Twitter is the *best* platform, I think that Twitter has truly changed the way we view and understand activism, social change, etc. It is obviously difficult to determine whether hashtag activism really brings about lasting, in-depth change (i.e. #Kony2012, #OccupyWallStreet), but to be able to spark discussion, interest, and action through Twitter and its hashtags has made social justice and activism accessible to so many more people. Obviously, it has also caused what has been dubbed "slacktivism," but it has been a pathway for many to move beyond typing on their computers.

##Question

- Twitter is on a decline, like many social media websites. How is Twitter's decline different, and what kind of effect might it have?
- Is defining "Black Twitter" another way in which America is othering African Americans, or is there legitimacy behind distinguishing the way African American youth is using Twitter vs. everyone else?
- McPherson presents a somewhat difficult to understand argument linking race issues and the development of code, but what can we take away from this that applies to the kind of change we can promote today?
