**Overview**

The Last Angel of History

In this exceptionally unique documentary, Black futurist visual artists provide an historical account of the intersections of tech and Black cultural expression. The documentarian uses George Clinton, Sun Ra and another artist as the foundations for the meeting of Black art and technology. Specifically, this documentary approaches this convergence through Black science fiction. Africa assumes a dual identity, one that is continent lost to a dark past and the other a land with an unknown future. A variety of interviewees spoke on the importance of spaceships as a vehicle for exploration into territory to claim for Black Americans, as reflected on a Parliament Funkadellic album. Viewers also are informed of the strides NASA made to integrate its facilities with the assistance’s of Nicholle Thomas of Star Trek fame. Next, we witnessed Bernard Harris speak on the visual importance of him being on the moon with a flag of all nations in Africa. This act was a symbolic gesture signifying an African claim to humanity. Finally, several interviewees made the argument that the Black existence and science fiction are not distinct entitles. The alien abductions, genetic mutations, alienation, and other themes of sci fi are the lived experiences of Black Americans. 

Eshun Article

I will not pretend to have understood the gist of Eshun’s thesis. Like McPherson, I think Eshun writes with an assumption that readers are familiar with some of the knowledge that he drops in this article. However, I’ll try my best to recap this piece. The article is a tackling of resistance to the Afro-English film group the Black Audio Film Collective (BAFC) and its style of film making. BAFC’s most influential work Handsworth Songs (1985) garnered praise, but I think Eshun’s point is that the subject matter, style of filming and politicization of film is where most criticism lay. Eshun mentioned that BAFC is an example or maybe even a product of postcolonial thought and a form of revenge on the liberalization and commodification of Black visual art. 

Tate Article

Tate should have begun this article with a definition for ontology. He discussed the intersection of performance and politics, arguing that Black Americans always act in a performative role. Black Americans are expected to perform, the expectation being that of larger and mainly white society. However, for Black Americans, visual and audio culture has always connected them to an ethereal presence. Whether listening to the sounds of jazz and blues or internalizing themes in a play or observing art, these observations are connected to a known and unknown spirituality unique to Black Americans. Tate referenced wind as an example of this idea. Referencing Negritude, the performance aspect of the ideology has a dual purpose. It expressed a mode of resistance for Black American. Slaves dancing a dance in opposition to their enslavement or rap and blues artists vocalizing the sorrows of their communities each represents modes of resistance against white rule. And yet, white American view these models as amusing forms of entertainment. In the latter half of the article, Tate engaged in a debate with visual artist Torkwase who voiced frustration over the lack of importance given to Black visual art. In opposition, Tate argued that examples Black culture has never been mainstream in their nascent stages and do not even have a need for immediate recognition. Further, Black visual artists must be open to failure as failure is an essential component of Black cultural history.

Sally Hemings Dreams- A Collaborative Zine

The aesthetic of the website is unique. Each panel has a different background. The blog is named from President Jefferson’s concubine/mistress/slave and the mother of several children. The blog was started by women of color and all its contributors seem to be women of color. There are two audio files on the blog. Both files are interesting forms of music that sounds futuresque, something you mind find in a science fiction film. For example, while listening to “The Storm” I thought of a ufo descending onto a grassy plain. The blog will become a year old in April. 

**Reflection**

I thought Octavia Butler’s statement on the two incompatible character traits of the human species was fascinating. Intelligence and our allegiance to hierarchy are these incompatible traits. Intelligence and I would add reason, which make humans are superior species is undermined by our savage reversion to hierarchy. With a hierarchy comes an oppressor class and an oppressed class and rules to establish order to prevent chaos against the ruling class. 

**Comment**

In response to Dikshant’s third question, I think artists (visual and audio) have always severed as the challengers to societal decay. Artists should produce works with meaning, even if that work is critical of a regime or ideology that may be “popular.” However, I have low expectations for artists to undertake their responsibility. Greenbacks are king, money is power. If we examine Beyoncé’s recent political awakening, it is recent. As someone who’s mother blasted Destiny’ Child and early Beyoncé music as a child, I do not remember a political tone or social message in her early week. It is only when we see Beyoncé transcend her nascent stage of mainstream celebrity that she became this politically charged person or an artist with a message.

Tate mentioned Harlem and its culture happenings. Gentrification is not the subject of Tate’s piece, but that practice has destroyed a lot of the Black culture of my youth. For example, the photo either above or below is a book stand on 125th street. Growing up, these bookstands adorned 125th street and offered residents books on Black political theory, adult novels and even natural herbs and incense as a rejection of the more commercial air freshener devices. Today, these bookstands are a rare site. 

**Questions**

* How does the title “Sally Hemings Dreams” give agency to Hemings and legitimize her life and her oppression? For over a century, there was an intellectual movement to disprove that this “founding father” could not have sired children with a slave. It’s only recently, through the fantastic work of Annette Gordon Reed that we get a fuller picture of the Hemings family and their lives. 

* Why aren’t Black sci fi authors given more respect in the American canon? What about their themes or messages are so uncomfortable for the literati to accept? Why did I read these authors in high school?

* Will there ever be a moment in music where Black sorrow is no longer profitable? What societal forces could produce such a change?
