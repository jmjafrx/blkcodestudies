Lab Log 4

# Overview: 

### McPherson

An early computer project at MIT created UNIX, a platform that still influences computers fifty years later. Concurrently with the UNIX project, Malcolm X was assassinated, and the Voting Rights Act passed. Other popular social movements launched and mass demonstrations took place. McPherson suggests that these two narratives are independent “operating systems,” of sorts. UNIX relies on a series of rules, including simplicity, robustness, parsimony, and modularity. Accordingly, this organization of information “powerfully responds” to racial justice movements. She also calls for “hybrid practices,” such as artist-theorists and programming humanists.

### Chude-Sokei

This piece relays the beginning of entertainer P.T. Barnum’s career with a showcase of Joice Heth, purported to by President Washington’s black mammy and 161 years of age. Apparently, this and Virginia Woolf’s invention of Victorian science fiction constitute the beginning of popular culture. The author then states that much of American popular culture, and therefor America’s global expansion and continued influence, is built upon some iteration of the “African aesthetic.” The author then paints a pretty damning picture of western society that romanticizes racism, reinforces its invented stereotypes, and dehumanizes the black person. White people have trouble coping with the uncanny similarities between themselves and people of color as a result.

### WIRED (Twitter)

This is a listicle of major events over the course of Twitter’s history, as told by tweets. The tweets range from strange to historically significant to unexplainable. Twitter’s history shows how quickly it caught on, as far is completely original conversation platforms go, and how Twitter’s increasing legitimacy as a news outlet has been paralleled by greater concerns for its hate speech and “fake news.”

### Sanders

Sanders follows up on an earlier Slate article about “black Twitter.” The first article was, understandably, very controversial because it “made something out of nothing,” as one critic put it. The follow up discusses how you can talk about a group of people who ought to be included in the conversation, not merely referred to in the third person. The original article also had some fairly offensive original artwork in the form of the Twitter bird’s black cousin. That divisive image was re-memed countless times and became a figurehead for the discussion of “black Twitter.”

### WIRED (BLM)

The WIRED article contrasts press technologies of the Civil Rights era with social media movements like Black Lives Matter that leverage free mass communication via Twitter. The Black Lives Matter movement is distinct in its non-institutional organization. The movement, according to its de-facto leaders, is not centralized or completely interconnected. Despite its modern, digitized presence, BLM has a lot in common with the civil rights movement. Namely, publicizing acts of violence to instigate activism in viewers. According to the author, Twitter has also heightened the experience of black Americans by exposing them to the BLM vernacular and links for resources to feed a growing interest in activism.

# Reflection:

The history of Twitter article was an excellent prelude to the BLM article. Juxtaposing twitter’s single decade of history and the civil rights movement’s nearly six decades lent perspective to the velocity of activism today. I think Twitter is facilitating critical masses of support for real progress in the same way the television coverage of school integration in the south or racial hate crimes did in the 60s. Regarding black twitter, I am surprised to see that opinions calling its existence a sham are accepted. I’ve heard tens of anecdotes about trends beginning in primarily-POC regions of the internet—but I also understand the relativity argument and do not relish the fact that a subconscious bias may be manifesting itself in my detection of such a region. I think this plays strongly into Chude-Sokei’s hand that we all see Black culture as a reflection of ideology—specifically, the differences between black and white. Finally, I’d like to say that the McPherson reading was totally unapproachable. I read her excessively florid and verbose writing trying to understand what academic argument she had for her thesis and struggled to find anything other than sentences designed to mask the absence of evidence. Perhaps it was meant to be theoretical. I do, however, believe that white-designed systems, even just for computers, do in some way disadvantage POC.

# Expand:

The BLM article reminded me of an image I saw on the internet last year with a banner sign reading “Hashtags are the new protest signs.”

# Comment:

Zoya asked the question of how we can practically remove systemic racism from technology. I imagine the obstacles to revising persisting systems are almost insurmountable. Therefore, patronizing and recognizing minority-owned start-ups via any number of Kickstarter campaigns or [incubators](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/ruchikatulshyan/2016/04/30/the-100-million-fund-thats-fostering-minority-startup-entrepreneurs/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/) seems like a simple and effective first step. 

# Question:

1. Does any six-degrees-of-separation-style analytics exist to show that the black community is disproportionately active/interconnected/followed on Twitter?
2. Where do online activists draw their legitimacy from? Can we expect professional leadership out of a hashtag inventor? (No disrespect to Alicia Garza, just wondering what her place is on the spectrum)
3. Where will online activities go after twitter? Despite its headlining-grabbing, Twitter isn’t in vogue for the masses or profitable for the media industry.
