#Summary

US Operating Systems at Mid-Century
In this piece Tara McPherson discusses the relationshiop between the code of the 1960s and the racial tendencies during this decade. She emphasizes that while it might not be obvious at first, race is very obviously embedded in the language of UNIX jargon and continues to make impacts on today's codes. She urges scholars of code and scholars of race to end their aversion to the internet and to look for the relations of race in coding.

The Uncanny History of Minstrels and Machines
Throughout this chapter, Louis Chude-Sokei goes over the relationship between the infatuation with both black bodies and machinery during the 1800s. He discusses the dehumanization of colored bodies through the process of turning them into literal machines. Referring to plantations as "social machines," he further underlines the problem with autonomy in and throughout the black experience in the US as the transition from slave to human was underway.

On Its 10th Birthday, a Short History of Twitter in Tweets
In this Wired article the life of Twitter is placed on a timeline. This goes over big events such as the first tweet from space, but it also covers the most retweeted photo of all time and the birth of memes on Twitter.

How Black People May or May Not Use Twitter
Throughout this NPR article Sam Sanders goes over the effect of a previous article that discusses the unique role that black youth plays on Twitter. While other people say that black people getting attention for doing certain things on Twitter isn't actually sensationalist, Sanders goes on to say that black youth really are using Twitter differently. This difference in usage of the social media site propels more "black posts" a longer way than "white posts," making for an interesting conversation.

How Black Lives Matter Uses Social Media to Fight the Power
Bijan Stephen, the author of this Wired article, observes the impact that social media has had on black activism. He uses quotes from one of the main contenders, DeRay McKesson, to further underline what exactly the Black Lives Matter movement has done because of its involvement with social media.

Reflection

I thouroughly believe that being black in America has changed solely based on the come up of social media. Like Stephen mentioned, the fact that millions of people can connect to a common expereince that now has jargon and is being studied is phenonemal. Tying in the actual code of computers however, is an interesting concept that I have never considered. The fact that associations were made within coding's fruition doesn't necessarily surprise me, however the nature of these associations were/are so prevalent that it's hard to believe that I thought they didn't exist at all at one point. The integration of blackness and the internet is one that holds endless analysis.

Reading the last article had me thinking about the first use of the word microaggression, so I thought I would leave that here: http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/02/microaggression.aspx

Comment

I noticed that one of the questions Zoya asked involved what the tangible results were of the Black Lives Movement, and even prior to reading the last article I had heard of the Campaign Zero Project. This was put in place and given to Attorney General at the time, Loretta Lynch, as a mulitple point plan to address systemic racism. I learned about it while writing my reasearch paper during my senior year of high school about the effect of Michael Brown's death. Pretty neat.

Question

The literal dehumanizing of Joice Heth was an act that I still cannot believe truly happened, did instances of this type happen often?
Without Twitter how far would the Black Lives Matter movement had gotten in comparison to where it is now?
Is Twitter's slow in new user growth a result of the increasing amount of activism found on the site? Or is it because there are no more people for Twitter to reach?
