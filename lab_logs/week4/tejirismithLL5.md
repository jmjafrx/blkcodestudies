# Overview

 * The Last Angel of History
 
 In this short film/ documentary there are two lines happening concurrently: the first is the journey of a nameless Data Thief. We know that he is able to travel through time, assumably with the use of a black box and slit-hole sunglasses. He is learning about the black race and terms associated with it. The other line in this film is a documentary type recount of several black musical artists whose genres range from jazz to funk to techno, all of them being focused around outer space/ the future/ science fiction. We also see interviews from astronauts, actors/ actresses, and authors. This film goes over the "otherness" that black people must play and how many artists has independently played with this role in their work. The film ends with the Data Thief ending his journey in Africa, why, the audience is not told. 
 
 * Black Ontology Now: Dark Matters and Meeting the Lady Gaga Challenge
 
 This article by Greg Tate, an author that was freatured in The Last Angel of History film, argues that black identity is inseparable from black entertainment. One point he makes that supports this claim is the fact that when slaves were brought to the United States, their arrival was met with one of merriment and music, already commodifying them before they even knew the implications. Tate draws upon similar modern expereinces to build his claim, but he also changes the way he writes his piece about 2/3s of the way through it. He starts writing almost in lyrical form, or a mode that mimics that of songs that are/ were "black." In this section he discusses dark energy and black holes and their relevance to the black experience. We also see a question posed to him by one of his colleagues, inquiring why black visual artists have nowhere near as much acclaim as black musical artists. His responses range, but one that I believed was the most sentinent was that he might not know why they were not as popular, but it was probably for the best. He concludes this piece with a side by side comparison of Harlem and Brooklyn. 
 
 * Untimely Medi 
 
 This journal selection by Eshun Kodwo, a critic that was featured heavily in The Last Angel of History, focuses on the role of the Black Audio Film Collective (BAFC). He begins by saying that several new black figures have decided that they are going to ignore the hypervisibility that is inherently being placed on black artists. (An interesting juxtaposition to Tate's claim about visibility and entertainment). He then moves into explaining the tides that the BAFC have begun with their embarking on releasing independent films. He then moves to describing specific films and explaining why certain choices were made in the filmography and the discography of them. One example of this would be in the film *Who Needs a Heart*, and the choice to make entire sections of the film silent. An interesting quote from John Akomfrah, producer of the film, explaining this choice most succinctly was, "sound itself had a gaze." In this he's referring to his choice to layer powerful jazz music over the silent sections of the film, a choice that at the time was avant-garde. 
 
 * Sally Hemming's Dream Zine 
 
 An online multi-media lookbook by Jamilah Felton and Jess Solomon featuring audio posts and quotes. One audio post that resonated with me greatly was the untitled one with the subtitle of "through the cicadas' hum I heard Lottie singing and also laughing."
 
 
 # Reflection
 
 Throughout the class we have made the decision that the very act of annoucning and being black is a political and empowering act. I can personally attest to this as a girl growing up with black American culture, Nigerian culture, and white American culture all at once, and figuring out how I was supposed to fit in that very unlikely (or so I thought) cross-section. However, in the Untimely Medi journal piecde by Kodwo he makes the claim that it's possible to ignore this hypervisibility, and not only that it can be done, but that it is being done. However Tate argues in his article that this is nearly impoosible, something that I find myself agreeing with. However if one could in fact "ignore their blackness" for lack of a more eloquent phrasing, then how would they go about doing it? How could something that has become so radicalized and fetishized be pushed to the side? It's just a concept that baffles me and quite frankly, reminds me of the "new black" phrase that went through certain black celebrities mouths. This "new black" is essentially all apologetic and "takes responsibility" for all the wrongs that black people have done to this country. It ignores color, it marginalizes the race, and infantilizes movements like Black Lives Matter. I guess I can sort of see this attempt at what Kodwo was describing, but if I read and understood it right, it really just sounds like a weak tap out of the continuous struggle that every black person has to take part in, at some level. 
 
 
 # Expand 
 
 When reading Tate's Back Ontology Now piece, he mentions the connection between anonymity and black people, and how the nothingness that exists around us has the potential to encapsulate our bodies. It reminded me of the up and coming rapper Noname, and her inital music. Now that she has her own album she doesn't really do this as much, but when she was first featured on Chance The Rapper's earlier mixtapes her verses almost always dealt with how she had no name and how she really didn't exist anywhere. [One song that has one of her mind blowing verses is Warm Enough on the SoX album.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jZt21590Ok)
 
 
 # Comment 
 
 In Channing's expand section for earlier this week she mentions a buzzfeed video that talks about the timeline of American slang and how it perfectly captures white people's fascination with and need to wreck literally anything that black people do ever. But as someone who "sounds white" I also felt like someone who really did a lot of peering in and imitating. I know it's kind of different because I'm black (not trans-racial, just black) but the way I talk when I'm on campus is slightly different from the way I talk when I'm back home. And it's not to make white people more confortable around me, but instead to feel like I belong in my group of colored friends. Like I said I don't really think it's a bad thing, but it's something that I've been noticing frequently and an interesting parallel that I thought I would share. 
 
 
 # Questions
 
 * Would Tate say that Kodwo's mentioning of black artists ignoring black "hypervisibility" is even possible? 
 
 * What makes soundscapes of the outside world so appealing? Specifically to black people? (referring to the second audio post on Sally Hemming's Drean Zine)
 
 * The act of black music being the only trustworthy source of history was a point that Tate made, but a lot of people would say that rap and hip hop are only reflective of the "bad parts" of black culture, what would be your response to that idea? (Disclaimer: I disagree with that balogna)
