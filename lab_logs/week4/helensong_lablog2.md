## Overview
The Last Angel of History is a film exploring the concept of Afrofuturism in black music and media, and how technology/space/sci-fi are interwoven in black culture and history. Along with the narrative of the "Data Thief," a character that travels through time and space, stealing information to unlock the future film, the film features interviews with several influential black figures in music, literature, science, film, and even an actual astronaut. The parallel between black people in America and aliens is also made, and what this means for black culture in the future is discussed.

Kodwo Eshun gives an in-depth account on how the Black Audio Film Collective (BAFC) changed the UK black film industry scene and how, unlike other black filmmakers who were eager to "deracialize" their work. The BAFC instead emphasized blackness and took on the responsibility of representing blackness in a market where it was hypervisible, but only for fetishization and commodification. Eshun explains that several of these artists opened up discourse by being radical in this way.

Greg Tate in his piece on Black Ontology discusses how entrenched the history of black America is in African-American music, especially in documenting trauma and other aspects of black identity. He also introduces the idea of Dark Energy, and contrasts black music with black visual arts in expressing Dark Energy.

In "Sally Hemmings Dream Zine," Jamilah Felton and Jess Solomon are selling their collaborative poetry zine that reflects on the thoughts of women who descended from slaves in a post-slavery society.


##Reflection
"Afrofuturism" is a term I've heard thrown around quite a bit but I've never been able to understand. The Last Angel of History was a very intense introduction to it, being both visually and intellectually over-stimulating, but I finally understand why sci-fi is so essential to black culture. And by tying in music and art into the equation, afrofuturism has become a concept I can not only somewhat grasph but also link to several key African-American cultural elements.

I really liked Janelle Monae's first two albums *Metropolis* and *ArchAndroid*, and I am only now realizing the influence afrofuturism has had on them. She literally portrays herself as an android/robot on her album artwork.

## Comment
I wanted to comment on Megan's point about how musicians vs. visual artists apply to other cultures, such as Korean music vs. Korean visual artists. I feel these are two really different cases because of how these artists make revenue, and who they make music for. Both Korean musicians and artists make money and are sponsored by consumers/investors in Korea, China, Japan, Thailand, etc., and as a result they mostly create music and art for Asian audiences. The music and art that does reach America is often commercialized and marketed, losing large parts of meaning or expression. On the other hand, black musicians and artists rely on American audiences for revenue, so the impact of Black music is much more significant.
## Question
 
1. How can black visual art exist beyond white/colonial institutions?
2. In what ways does Afrofuturism show us the future of black music and art?
