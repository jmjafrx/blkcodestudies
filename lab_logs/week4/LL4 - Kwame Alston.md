##Overview

* “On Its 10th Birthday, a Short History of Twitter in Tweets | WIRED.”  

This was a rather short article about the beginning of twitter. It goes in chronological order of the achievements of the platform. It measures this through various tweets. 

* Sanders, Sam. “How Black People May Or May Not Use Twitter.”

The article is a  response to the contrrosery from the from the Slate article ["How Black People Use Twitter."](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2010/08/how_black_people_use_twitter.html) The article talkas about how this non-black author is making a big deal about the way black people use twitter. It focuses on different people's reaction and the controversy around the black twitter bird they used.

* “How Black Lives Matter Uses Social Media to Fight the Power.” WIRED. 2015

This article focuses on the use of technology in  protest. It starts with an overview of the past uses and how activist from the 60's disseminated information. It talked about how technology used today allows for the quick release of information and has the ability galvanize groups. It also talks about the weakness in the current forms of information, such as the ability for people to anonymously send hate and the ability of government agencies can monitor activist activities.

*    McPherson, Tara. “US Operating Systems at Mid-Century.” In Race after the Internet, edited by Lisa Nakamura and P Chow-White, 2013

In this piece McPherson goes throughout the history of computer systems and draws parallels between race historians and tech historians. Her main argument is that both of historians have too fine of scopes on the narratives they are telling. She believes it is not possible to fully understand the topics without talking about each other. How can you talk about the civil rights movement without talking about the raise of the different technological advances that helped the movement? The reading is very slow and hard to understand at various times so I do not understand why she criticizing academics for doing the same.

* Chude-Sokei, Louis. “The Uncanny History of Minstrels and Machines, 1835-1923,”

Chude tells the history of the minstrels. He starts this narrative off by talking about P.T. Barnum, the founder of Barnum & Bailey Circus and a man who made his name on the explorations of different peoples, and Joice Heth. Joice Heth was a slave women that Barnum bought and passed off as George Washington's 161 years old mammy as a tourist exhibit. He set the precedent for the  of black people in minstrels and the creation of these characters. These images would go on to create negative stereotypes of blacks and used to justify racist ideals. 

##Reflection
1. It was very interesting in the Chude reading when they talked about the creation of the word "robot." Despite the fact that the word "robot" is coined in 1923, the root being from the Czech word, robota, meaning serifs or slave labor we see that Joice Heth was one of the first "robots".  When Barnum or "a visitor" releases the letter attempting to say Joice is a hoax and actually a machine similar to the Turk she becomes the first reboot. She is stripped of her humanistic qualities and no longer a person. Despite the fact that she is a human being in white people's mind she was nothing more than a well made machine. 

2.  One thing I believe that Slate writer,  Farhad Manjoo, was right to do was look at Black Twitter. His article detailing all his discoveries was not worth the bandwidth it occupied as the article was very voyeuristic and could be applied to any groups of people on using the twitter platform. I do think; however black youth have lead the charge on uses of the site. Top Tweets and the most retweeted tweets often come from this group. The raise of young black vine stars was amazing to and created a air of black joy on the website. This was something that should have been talked about in the article and could have been articulated in much better fashion.

These articles details how vine closing is such a sad thing for black and brown people because the platform was so accessible. 

##Comments
Answering Dikshant's 3rd question: I do not thinking that the shareholders are actually worried about the stagnant growth in twitter. With the closing of vine and the deleting of various services on twitter that are not performing well it is clear that they are signaling to be bought and companies are ready to bite. Twitter even with stagnant growth has access to a lot of "big data" that any company would die to have access too for ads and the creations of personalized apps. I feel like twitter is going to be bought out in the next 3 years.


## Questions
1. Does Black Twitter truly exist if the platform as a whole is owned by white men?

2. With the rise of technology and surveillance are there any true safe networks that we can use to communicate?

3. Why don't we invest in a black network similar to twitter? Black people  run twitter: however, we have seen the website will silence us when they see fit.
