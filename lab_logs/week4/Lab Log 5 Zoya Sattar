### Overview
Kodwo Eshun in "Untimely Media". This article opens with the film Handsworth Songs at Documenta11. He reflects on the Black Audio Film Collection, or BAFC for short, and how their production of this movie helped introduce a new generation to this relatively unknown company. The BAFC was a 'racial interruption in European cinema', one that constantly reminded the world of the realness of the black narrative on screens. 

Greg Tate in "Black Ontology Now: Dark Matters and Meeting the Lady Gaga Challenge". He talks about the black juke-joint supremacy, one built on the knowledge with sound. Music is power, and I've always viewed it as part of the essence of the black soul and experience of America. 

Jamilah Felton and Jess Solomon's Tumblr is entitled "Sally Hemmings Dreams Zine". The Zine set up is beautiful. After working with Tumblr, I really admire how they formatted their layout. I'm finding that I am a big fan of the layouts where pictures come and go, smoothly flowing from one to the next. On the Tumblr itself, each pane has a different sound bite or graphic. Poetry and images combine to form a visually appealing and mentally stimulating preface for the zine.

The Last Angel of History film was based around the concept of Afrofuturism in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. This movement centered a science fictional and futuristic aspect of the artistic creativity of black artists in areas from music to literature. This became a cultural aesthetic for the time. Under the premise of a 'data thief' stealing fragments of culture from the past in order to unlock the future, the film explores the different aspects of afrofuturism in this time period through the interviews of prominent figures in the movement. Icons such as George Clinton, Dr Bernard Harris Jr, and Samuel Delaney comment on how the essence of their visions was to comment on the fact that black people were treated as aliens on their own planet in their own homes, and so looked to the stars for escape. Of course, these words encompass a whole genre of various thoughts and actions on what afrofuturism is. 
### Reflection
I was shook, so to speak, when I read about how black people were considered aliens in links to science fiction. I had never thought about the issue like this, and after taking a second to absorb the words, it made perfect sense. It is a profound realization that this is our reality. What Black Code does is continuously introduce me to new perspectives to view the history of blacks in America, expanding my knowledge base. I enjoyed learning about the more creative side of the African experience in America this past week. 
### Expand
I had never heard of the term afrofuturism before today. I decided to do a little more research, and loved the imagery created for this. Below is an example of an image describing the genre.

### Comment
Going off of Jack's comment on how he was floored by all the articles, I want to extend how much I was fascinated by this set of readings. They all had such different viewpoints and topics in the same thread, and they ehlped introduce a wholly new concept to me.
### Questions
* This might sound ignorant, but do foreign groups such as the BAFC make films on topics related to slavery in America specifically? Or do they focus on other narratives?
* In the film Last Angel of History, I had trouble understanding why there was a constant stream of fast-moving pictures with high-pitched noise throughout the film. Was it meant to keep the audience engaged, or just as fillers, or was there a deeper purpose?
* As mentioned in the Last Angel of History, why did NASA not push forward more the fact that they had an interracial staff that worked with each other to put man on the moon?
