# Overview: 

### Handler, Jerome S., and Annis Steiner. "Identifying Pictorial Images of Atlantic Slavery: Three Case Studies.”

Handler and Steiner bring light to on ongoing issues in the digital humanities: attribution and commercializations of images of slavery. They explore case studies to illustrate how this has become a problem. The first regardless Charles and David Livingston’s 1865 narrative, which displays an unattributed engraving, which continued to be misattributed or not cited thereafter. Another case concerns an image of a bound and masked Brazilian slave. The image, drawn by Jacques Arago, is rarely cited as the primary source. Further, the historical context of the image is rarely included. The authors then conclude that it is crucial that researchers pay as much attention to illustrations and their contexts as they do to citing their written sources.

### Morgan, Jennifer L. “Some Could Suckle over Their Shoulder”

Morgan discusses how racialist discourse was influenced by ideas of gender and sexuality. Travelers who documented the bodies they saw in Africa and America dismissed reality and relied and reproducing tropes that would resonate with European audiences. They employed stereotypes of beastliness and savagery in service of racial differentiation. Women’s bodies, specifically, were the target of generalizations about deviant sexuality and physicality. Also, women were portrayed as cannibals, childless, and with negatively morphed bodies. Women were frequently described as having long breasts that hung down to their waists, or long enough to lay over their shoulders. Black women were thus characterized as able-bodied, emotionally detached, fecund, and savage at the same time.

### Interview: Kara Walker Decodes Her New World Sphinx at Domino Sugar Factory

This interview with Kara Walker runs through the creative process that led to her massive sphinx, titled, “A Subtlety.” Inspired by Medieval sugar sculptures, Kara Walker filled a disused Brooklyn sugar refinery with a 35 foot, sugar-coated Sphinx. She discusses the enormous contradictions of building a Mammie figure on the site of a plant steeped in cash crop history. She also addresses the sculpture’s controversies (i.e. its stereotypical physical features).

# Reflect:

It was interesting to learn about the origin of the countless derogatory stereotypes of African women that sometimes preceded actual encounters between the author and the subject. Horrifyingly, but maybe not surprisingly, these adventurers would see one thing and write home something totally different. This seems to be a classic lip service to European expectations, a reinforcement of cultural superiority that sells travel narratives and coddles insecurities. We’ve talked about Kara Walker’s “A Subtlety” a lot, but I still think the piece deserves all the attention it can get. I think it is her most important piece of work—much like other artists, it is the piece that fuses Walker’s most challenging aesthetics with her most mainstream context.

# Expand:

I wanted to read more about slavery and sugar. [Here’s what I read.](http://clements.umich.edu/exhibits/online/sugarexhibit/sugar06.php)

# Comment:

Ellie asked about Kara Walker’s sculpture versus her previous silhouette work. I think of it like a 3-D realization of what she’s already done. This time, the appropriated artwork in the background is the industrial-slavery complex.

# Question:
1. Was anyone surprised that Kara Walker didn’t know very much the connection between sugar and slavery?
2. To what extent have stereotypes about the black woman’s body become “trendy” to appropriate in popular culture?
3. Has ownership of the black person’s archive been transferred to the black person via sites like twitter/facebook/instagram/tumblr?
