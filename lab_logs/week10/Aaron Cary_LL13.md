# Overview
This week’s readings focus on visual representations and misrepresentations of black bodies. 

**Handler, Jerome S., and Annis Steiner. "Identifying Pictorial Images of Atlantic Slavery: Three Case Studies."**
Handler describes the implicit dangers of incorrectly citing or describing visual representations of the slave trade in three instances. He remarks that seldom do authors and publishers care about what the visual representations are that accompany their texts, as along as they seem interesting.  It is difficult to tell if the scene is situational or imagined and context becomes muddled.

**Morgan, Jennifer L. “‘Some Could Suckle over Their Shoulder:' Male Travelers, Female Bodies, and the Gendering of Racial Ideology, 1500-1770."**
Morgan studies early accounts of colonizers such as Richard Ligon, as they describe the black female body and the implications of the European assessment of their bodies within a visual archives of  The purpose of these visual archive is to build a more robust sense of difference and disparity between black and white figures, describing females’ physical features in a manner akin to “animal-like reproductive units.” These visual misrepresentations contributed to the the solidification of a racial ideology. By deliberately highlighting sexuality, these observers painted indigenous women as monster-like savages who, by virtue of differing physical features, should be treated as livestock. This becomes complicated a simultaneous representation of beauty and civility and sensuality that observers made difficult to reconcile.

**“Interview: Kara Walker Decodes Her New World Sphinx at Domino Sugar Factory.”**
This Complex Q&A with Kara Walker on her installation A Subtlety, delves deep into her thought process. You can learn about inspirations for the exhibit, and understand the artist’s own ideas about what the piece means in a historical and present context.  

# Reflection
Handler’s piece came down to properly citing sources in order to have them properly represented in context, which I feel is much more a literary contextualization argument than a black code studies argument. Especially because in the cases mentioned, the producers of the images were white and their histories documented relatively well. This isn’t a situation in which the conditions of the trans-Atlantic slave trade destroyed, impeded, or manipulated a visual archive produced by a black person.

# Expand
Kara Walker’s commentary on art and trauma.

# Comment
To Tejiri’s second question, I think the current dichotomy of gendered racial ideology is between talking about white women’s faces with an extremely specified, almost scientific revery, where black women are judged first and foremost by their bodies.

# Question
* How can slaves be visually represented as more than victims of their trauma?
* What other types of commodities do black people have a historied relationship with and how could those be visually represented?
* How can improper citations be prevented and should they be updated?
