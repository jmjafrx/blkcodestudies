Sargent Interview with Kara Walker

Antwaun Sargent interviews visual artist Kara Walker who undertook a project to immortalize the toils of sugar production during slavery in the America. The piece, titled Subtlety or the Marvelous Sugar Baby is a sphinx like structure of a black woman covered with a kerchief. The figure expanded more than 30,000 square feet, taking up most the space in the now demolished Dominion Sugar factory in Brooklyn. Walker became interested in the relationship between sugar and slavery and sought to use Subtlety to connect a historical past with the present. Subtlety’s figure is a woman of the African diaspora that Walker intentionally portrays as a caricature of a sexualized mammy figure. Walker designed the figure with large breasts and buttocks as a reminder white male intrigue and sexual prowess of the slave period. An interesting characteristic that Walker carves 

Morgan Article

Jennifer Morgan examines descriptions of Black female bodies by white male travelers of English origins. Her focuses on “racialist” discourse and how such discourse informed ideas of gender and sexual difference during slavery and how this manifested into how Black women were treated. Morgan traces the descriptions of African and indigenous women recorded by Richard Ligon. Ligon’s descriptions waver between sexualizing African and indigenous women and referring to them as demonic or subhuman/non-human.  Morgan also recounts the travels of Girolamo Benzoni who offered a disturbing assessment of the European view of indigenous women. Benzoni decried an indigenous woman’s celebration of traditional tribal appearance as devil-like and monstrous. Moreover, he added that fornication with indigenous women could harm Spanish purity and should be avoided by Spaniards. 
 
Handler and Steiner Article

Handler and Steiner discuss three attribution inaccuracies of three widely circulated images of the history of slavery. Their argument highlights the lack of accurate identification of source materials, particularly images, drawings and engraving for historiography of slavery. An engraving of a slave coffle is the first image that Handler and Steiner analyze. Originally published in Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi and its Tributaries (1865), the image captures a train of chained African men, women, and children taken by African slave traders. The image has been reproduced by nineteenth and twentieth century authors, but without the correct source attribution to its original source. In one publication, the original publishers of the engraving are listed, but a false description of the image is provided. The second image, African Thrown from Slave Ship, first appeared in The Liberator. Throughout the nineteenth century, this drawing became a symbol of the anti-slavery/pro-abolitionist cause. The image depicts the murder of slaves deemed too sick for sale in the Americas. However, since there has been little attribution for this project, the image’s historical scene is subject to the archivist’s discretion. For example, Handler and Steiner noted the image is incorrectly considered the Zong incident. The final set of images of Brazilian slaves were originally published in a series of books on Brazilian slavery, but have come to symbolize the brutality of slavery in the Americas. The attribution to Brazil’s specific harsh form of slavery and Jacques Arago’s accounts of the treatment and condition of slaves is entirely ignored. 

Reflection

I thought Walker’s use of the sphinx as the body of the African woman was an interesting choice. In the academy, the histories of Egypt and West Africa are usually kept separate. At Hopkins, for example, Ancient Egyptian history is taught in Near Eastern Studies. Walker merged two well-known symbols of Egyptian (sphinx) and African diasporic history (mammy), which almost reconnects Egyptian history into its rightful category of Africana history.

In Morgan’s article, I was struck by Ligon’s categorization of African women on Cape Verde. He praised women of “high Africa”, those who possessed more European features and social customs. He demonized other women who appeared with native features such as thick lips, shorts noses and low foreheads. Ligon’s approval of these so called high African women, but disapproval of other African women is the earliest example of colorism that I have encountered in my studies. 

Comment

To answer Megan’s third question, I think that there are examples of the objectification of Black women in music, television and film.  I guess I am confused by your definition of perception. If you mean to ask if Black women’s bodies are still thought of as demonic, then I would say the perception has changed somewhat. I think Ligon’s description of exotifying mixed race Black woman while describing darker skinned Black women as savages has persisted through colorism within the Black community.

[Fetishism of Black Women in Mainstream Culture](http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/12/06/fetishism-black-women-mainstream-culture-history-future/)

Here is an interesting article from the *Atlanta Black Star* written by Christina Montford on social media’s role in the continued sexualized perceptions of Black women. 


Question

1. Do you think Kara Walker’s Subtlety will have a lasting impact? What about the piece’s demolishment reduces and helps its legacy?

2. On social media, it is easy to share a photo without verifying any information related to the image. Sometimes, the meanings of these images are lost or distorted. How do you think digital historians can prevent such distortions from occurring in their social media postings about their research?

3. Can you recall an image or quote that you attributed to an event or person that you later found out was inaccurate?
