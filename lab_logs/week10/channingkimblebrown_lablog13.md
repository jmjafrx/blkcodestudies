### Overview

**"Identifying Pictorial Images of Atlantic Slavery: Three Case Studies"**

* This piece details the importance of fact-checking the citations of slave images because several images produced at that time are ambiguous, credited to the wrong person/publication, or has inaccurate metadata about what it is depicting. Handler and Steiner first discuss an image of a slave coffle in South Africa that shows slaves being brought to the East African slave trade but often is used to illustrate transatlantic slave trade. The second study is of an image of africans being thrown from a slave ship that was originally created for an abolitionist paper in Brazil but the image was used over and over in different countries like France and England to depict their people doing similar things, but rarely was the source material proparly credited. The last study focused on a picture of a slave with a face mask and neck collar which prevented slaves from committing suicide by eating dirt. This image and many others like it were later incorrectly captioned saying that the mouth was covered for talking too much or stealing. Images are too often taken at face value in research and these details must be considered.

**"'Some Could Suckle over Their Shoulder:' Male Travelers, Female Bodies, and the Gendering of Racial Ideology, 1500-1770"**

* This work describes the use of women, gender and race by European men to distance Europe from Africa and the Americas and to justify their exploitation and enslavement of the people indigenous to those continents. Blackness and beauty required each other to exist in contrast and European men would switch back and forth between portraying black women as monsters or beasts, giving birth without experiencing pain and having breasts that sagged low enough to drag on the ground, walking around without clothes and being "sexually deviant" by satisfying their own sexual desires, even cannibalizing their own children. On the flip side, black women were beautiful seductresses that were strong and capable, more so than European women. Both portrayals of black and brown women were used to tie their entire races to inferiority. European writers and illustrators that travelled abroad were responsible for many of the negative preconcieved notions of African and Indigenous American people thanks to their descriptions of how much less civilized black and brown women are.

**"Interview: Kara Walker Decodes Her New World Sphinx at Domino Sugar Factory"**

* Kara Walker is an artist that created a sculpture called _A Subtlety_. The sculpture, situated in a Domino Sugar Refiner in Williamsburg, is huge and covered in white refined sugar, surrounded by little boys made of molasses. _A Subtlety_ depicts an mammy-like African American woman posed like a sphinx, exposed and somewhat submissive yet dominant. Walker discusses how she spent months thinking about what to make and how she wanted to create a visual representation of the world's history with sugar and the lives and limbs lost to making something that tastes so sweet and innocent. It's called _A Subtlety_ because wealthy people used to have small political sugar paste sculptures as desserts during medieval times that the guests of the king would know to be of political or religious importance. Walker says that _A Subtlety_ is meant to evoke power and memories of the life and labor extracted from people to create a luxury item whose production isn't significantly better to this day and to undermine the reading of caricatures of black people.

### Reflection

These pieces are interesting because they all seem to emphasize the same point, which is to be very, very careful about believing how something is protrayed and the significance of the marginalized representing themselves artistically. The fact that so many images are not properly cited or just have nothing at all is disturbing, not so much because of the state of citation but more the fact that this has been allowed to go on for so long without any major effort to correct it. It allows these images to spread misinformtaion and rewrites history in ways that can be damaging. The reading about the gendering of racial ideology was even more disturbing because it talked about how writers and authors have the power to shape all of Europe's thoughts and feelings about people indigenous to Africa and the Americas. They were able to write and draw anything they wanted, even contradict themselves, and it was all ultimately used to push the justification for enslaving and murdering millions. These European travellers stole the likeness of these women abroad, distorted their images withot any consent, and painted their entire peoples as beasts and monsters. Walker's interview is somewhat comforting in the face of these other two readings. She was able to take a dehumanizing mammy figure and the exploitative sugar refinement industry and create a visual that changed the narrative and gave black women some power and dignity back, forcing people to think about how slaves in the Caribbean and black women have deserve to be seen and recognized for all the horrible things they were put through for the bright, white refined sugar that so many crave uncritically.

Seeing the image of slaves being thrown overboard made me think of this movie, _Belle_, because the main character's grandfather is deciding whether or not to end the British slave trade because of a case of an English captain throwing allegedly sick slaves overboard to claim property damage and collect insurance money. There was a huge debate about whether slaves should be considered people or property.

### Comment

To answer [Turquoise's first question](https://github.com/turquoisebaker/blkcodestudies/blob/dae20c36593de0ce7f4a092b4e6283fdf843983d/lab_logs/week9/turquoisebaker_LL13.md) I think it starts with exposure to images of all types of people being protrayed as beautiful. The media plays a huge part in this, the toy industry, movies, tv shows, the fashion and cosmetics industries, are all largely responsible for teaching the public what beautiful looks like. If they were to start actually celebrating people of all colors, shapes, sizes, religious expressions, and abilities without fetishizing, exotifying (this may not be a word... but you get the idea) or infantilizing them, we would have a very different idea of what beauty looks like.

### Question
1. Was there a common practice or citation format used during the time of transatlantic slave trade? 
2. Do other historical researchers of different topics also have the same struggles of finding properly cited and contextualized images?
3. How can we overcome this use of women of color, especially black women, to further distance whiteness from everyone else? To this day people minimize or ignore the pain of black women, now manifesting in the insidious "Strong Independent Black Woman" trope that is so often an excuse to abuse black women and not feel guilty about it. What can be done to educate people about how damaging this idea is and the historical roots that it has?
