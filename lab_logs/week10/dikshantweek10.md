# Overview
* Identifying Pictorial Images of Atlantic Slavery: Three Case Studies.
In this article Handler and Steiner discuss the problematic practice of incorrectly describing visual representations of the slave trade. They point to three instances to prove their point about misrepresentation. Ultimately they make an argument about treating historical artifact as simply trivial, and the fallacies within that practice. They conclude by saying that both the visual work and bibliography of a particular work is important; absent the historical context, the work becomes lost only within the visual without the audience being able to fully appreciate the artists motive. 

* Some Could Suckle over Their Shoulder: Male Travelers, Female Bodies, and the Gendering of Racial Ideology
Morgan's article is focused on the hetero Eurocentric descriptions of the black female body. By focusing on the colonial representation of the traveler, Morgan shows the contrasting images of white and black women. How black women's beauty is reduced and interpreted to be regressive and primitive. Through this interpretation, Morgan suggests how black female bodies become understood and within that process becomes racialized.   

* "Interview Kara Walker Decodes Her New World Sphinx at Domino Sugar Factory"
Kara Walker talks about her new piece at the Domino Sugar Factory and talks about her work process. She makes an interesting connection between molasses, sugar and slavery that molasses is like slavery because it seems to always be there in the periphery. She also makes the connection that slavery is like sugar because no one ever questions the origins of the products, they just assume that it is produced. 

# Comment
I found the interview with Kara Walker to be very thought provoking. My favorite part is when she discusses whiteness of sugar cubes. What i found interesting was how she talks about the fact that the whiteness of the sugar represents the way whiteness as a concept extends beyond social interactions. When sugar is first produced, it is mixed in to give a dark white shade instead of pure white. I drew a commonality to slavery and cotton, how the end product of cotton, the clean and soft texture, is not given once you pick cotton instead it is something you refine. I also liked how she talked about recognition, that at the end of the day neither the slave nor the sugar producer gets credit for their work, instead it is part of the culture of capitalism and whiteness that is reflected through the individual who owns that product.

Reading Handler and Steiner's piece make me think about the Oprah, Whoppi Goldberg controversy at the Oscars when a popular news outlet tweeted a picture of Whoopi captioning it as Oprah. It's just interesting to how misrepresentation occur among prominent black celebrities even in the digital age (RE: Ben Carson and Cuba Gooding Junior)

# Comment
To answer JB's third question, yes I do. Last year when the school newspaper printed a picture of Cuba Gooding Jr. playing Ben Carson in the movie Gifted Hands to portray the real Ben Carson. I was shocked and disappointed.

# Questions
1. Initially looking at Walkers piece, what did you think the sugar represented?
2. In your opinion, what is the effect of misrepresenting visuals?
3. Do you see a commonality in the way Morgan describes white travelers describing black female bodies back then to now?
