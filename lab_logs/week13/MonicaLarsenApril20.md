## Overview
### Kim Gallon, Black Digital Humanities, "Debates in the Digital Humanities" 2016
Gallon makes a case for the Black Digital Humanities in order to give a Black space in a predominantly White space. She argues that the Black Digital Humanities provides a place for the digital humanities to be seen through the lens of Blackness and makes the digital humanitites more humanistic. Black digital humanities allows for change and reflection, while providing a forum for Black thought and progress.
### Weheliye, "Engendering Phonographies: Sonic Technologies of Blackness" Small Axe
Weheliye makes the point that the closer a group is presumed to be to whiteness, the more power it posesses, and the closer a group is presumed to be to blackness the less power it possesses. She argues that there is spectrum of power which all racial groups are unequally ordered along. She goes on to analyze "Phonographies" and criticizes it for lacking conceptual gendered analysis, because the omission of the importance of the role that sexuality and gender play in the lives of Black folks cannot be ignored.
### Haynes, Tonya. “Mapping Caribbean Cyberfeminisms.” Sx Archipelagos, no. 1 (May 1, 2016).
Haynes describes and shines a light on multiple Caribbean cyberfeminists blogs to showcase the work that they do because it has been overlooked by scholars mapping women and feminist's movements in the Caribbean. Caribbean cyberfeminists often link their online work to on the ground action and form a tight coalition of activism, all the while creating a digital archive of Caribbean feminist movements.
### Wangechi Mutu
The first thing that appears on Wangechi Mutu's website is an image of blue and black braids woven into the top of a woman's head. As the page loads splatters of art cover parts of the woman's head. The cursor is an image of a black woman's hand with a glove of sorts and the side bar must be opened by pressing the little scissor icon on the right hand side of the page. This website is absolutely beautiful and has tabs for art, books, history, news, and representation. 
## Reflection
All of these sources highlight women in digital media and bring forth a new perspective on a Black space (especially a black woman's space) in a space dominated by white people. Whether it be the Black Digital Humanities, Sonic technologies, Caribbean cyberfeminists, or black art, all of these women contribute to black code studies by giving the unique perspective that is often overlooked when talking about black activism---the perspective of a non-male person.

Wangechi Mutu, Brooklyn-based Kenyan artist.
## Comment
In response to Turquoise, "Years from now, how will mainstream images of black people be understood and interpreted?", I think that it really depends on how many years from now and it will always depend on who is viewing the image. Images can often be made to misrepresent someone, so I'd hope that mainstream images of black people will be questioned.
## Question 
* Have you had the chance to look at more of Wangechi Mutu's art? What stands out most about it?
* Why do you think that while so many African artists are overlooked and forgotten, Wanchengi was able to insert herself into a white dominated space?
* How can Caribbean women's art/digital work be showcased more?
