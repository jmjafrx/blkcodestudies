# Overview

* Deborah Gray White, "My History in History," Telling Histories, 85-100

In this section of White's anthropological book, *Telling Histories: Black Women Historians in the Ivory Tower,* we see a brief, yet moving description of White's academic life and how she got to where she was at the time of publishing this novel. She begins with her high school experiences, being at an all-girls school and how racism still evaded her existence. She moves on to her first college and how fortunate she was to be a recipient of affirmative action at its peak, and from here she continues to discuss how her goal for tenure and professional recognition shaped her relationships, self-image, and overall progress. She concludes her succinct overview of her life with a toast to the work that her book is doing in history and how its impact is a step in the right direction, no matter how small the step.

* Wynter, Sylvia. "1492: A new world view." Race, discourse, and the origin of the Americas: A new world view (1995): 5-57.

Within the first few pages of her book, Sylvia Wynter establishes then upsets two viewpoints about the year 1492. She first introduces these viewpoints, the first being that Columbus' journey was one of explorative discovery and trade-offs, while the other view being that his arrival to the Americas began the long journey of exploitation and decimation of a people. After she explores these arguments she then arrives at her own, seemingly unbiased conclusion: that we should look at the events of 1492 as a result of the construction of race due to Spanish intervention in Sub-Saharan Africa. Wynter also brings in concepts like superordinate goals, religion, epic poetry, and various schools of philosophy to support her third group view. Essentially, she explains that the establishment of human order and other constructed aspects of the human experience are what drove the incidents of 1492 to fruition. 

* Figueroa, Yomaira C. "Reparation as transformation: Radical literary (re) imaginings of futurities through decolonial love." Decolonization: Indigeneity, Education & Society 4, no. 1 (2015).

Figueroa begins her narrative with the claim that in order to achieve long-lasting reparations (for any group of people, but in this case those based out of the Caribbean) there must be decolonial love. Essentially she gives three categories that must be fulfilled in order to thie love to be decolonial: that it acknowledges humanity, that it acknowledges violence, and that in spite of colonial differences it can exist. After establishing these general ideas about ehat exactly is decolonial love, she moves into what it can do for reparations. Figueroa then explains the history of reparations themselves, beginning with the actual word. She goes through its Latin, French, and English interreptations and definitions. The most important fact to take from this section however is the distinction made between monetary and decolonial reparations. The remainder of the narrative uses *The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Woa* and *Matinga: sangre en la selva* to help shape and model what a world that used decolonial love as a means of reparation. Figueroa explores the themes of feminism, colonialism, and kinship in the context of these two books and as an introduction to the "praxis of decolonial love."

* Gumbs, How She Knew, Spill: Scenes in Black Feminist Fugitivity

In this non-traditional article Alexis Gumbs discusses the strides made and "herstories" preserved by the work of black feminists, womanists, and enthusiasts online. Gumbs begins with a quote from Audre Lorde that she uses to frame the rest of the piece. Using phrases from the diary quote, Gumbs mentions the products of several online blogs and other online platforms to create a space where black queer women were welcome and remembered.

* Fabiola Jean-Louis - Rewriting History

An online archive of pieces of art by Jean-Louis that each are more haunting than the next. The artist uses photography and paper to craft images of black women that are both opposing to European history and empowering to black people. The end result is one that is unsettling, but beautiful.


# Reflection

While reading these pieces I think one aspect that stood out to me was avoiding the contination of violence *by* disrupting and reassembling histories. This theme was prevalent in the narrative by Yomaira Figueroa about the importance of decolonial love. One of the first requirements of this type of love is acknowledging violence and being able to remember it while still moving forward and upward. A few weeks ago, during the database module a very similar task was given to us: craft a history that uses the same violent material but don't let the new product continue this violence. This same ideology is, I think, what drives the work that Figueroa is promoting: in order to achieve meaningful reparations, we must face the effects of different modes of violence head on. While she is not advocating for fighting this violence with reconstructed violence, it is interesting to see where the two ideas meet.


# Expand

Immediately upon reading the Figueroa and Sylvia Wynter pieces I thought of [this article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/georgetown-university-formally-apologizes-for-role-in-slavery_us_58f75b3de4b029063d3566e6) as something I could share. A step in right direction is a step worth acknowledging.


# Comment

In response to the second half of Turquoise's second question, "What does a movement that embraces the “stereotypical American Negro” look like compared to a movement that understands even deeper meanings of black identity and hatred which Baldwin speaks to?" I believe it's a society that holds dear to depth. That's the main factor missing from the current society we are in and the one Baldwin explains. To say that we haven't progressed would be a gross brush off the shoulder for all the people who have worked to improve not only the condition, but the perception of black people. So if I were to pick "what's missing" I would say thoughtfulness. 


# Questions

* Could the reason that Jean-Louis uses paper as the mode for the dresses be because of its mallebility? (Similar to that of black peoples resolve over centuries of maltreatment?)

* What would Audre Lorde think of Deborah Gray White's path to tenure and professional security? 

* In creating a third narrative for the debate on the effects of the year 1492, could Wynter be harming the indigenous community?
