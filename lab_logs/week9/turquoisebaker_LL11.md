#### Overview

Brown, Vincent. “Mapping a Slave Revolt Visualizing Spatial History through the Archives of Slavery.” Social Text 33, no. 4 125 (December 1, 2015): 134–41

- In this article, Vincent Brown asserts that in depth discussions about the African Diaspora, slavery, and other Black historical events are omitted or suppressed in various narratives. However, there are ways to study the sources which disregard this information to uncover hidden truths. Brown uses the example of his digital map of The Jamaican Slave Revolt (1760-1761): a map created by tracing patterns within various sources and displaying them with the “rhetoric” practice of “cartographic visualization” (137). This map chronologically illustrates the rebels’ strategies and “tactics of counterinsurgency” (136). Although successful in giving geographical information about the revolt, the map, Brown notes, does have its limits. A comprehensive understanding of the event requires the multiple resources and other sources, qualitative and quantitative. Being creative with methods of Sources are “artifacts of complex processes rather than transparent reflections of past worlds” (134).

Egan, Shannon, "Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)" (2013). Schmucker Art Catalogs. Book 2. 

- Kara Walker, distinguished artist known for her power artwork exploring the Black body, gender and “racist pathology”, created “Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)”. By using images from the edition of the same name, published in 1866 by Alfred H. Guernsey, and overlaying them with silhouettes of black bodies, Walker adds another dimension to the images which suppress a “larger social history”. The silhouettes are not meant to seamlessly blend in with the images, but to be seen as the focus of the images to encourage viewer to study “a black body in the present tense”. 

Evergreen Museum - Seventeen Portraits of Black Civil War Soldiers

- These portraits are found in Captain William A. Prickitt’s two-inch-tall album. The album has been passed down in the Prickitt family for many generations. The men in this album were a part of the 25th Regiment, United States Colored Troops (USCT), Company G, of the Union Army. 

#### Reflection

- This week, my favorite article/complication was "Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)". One does not need to be a historian like Vincent Brown to illuminate truths about the Black experience. Walker did so by appealing to the social struggles and social history. Humanizing Blacks and allowing for a discussion of Black existence (then and now) as bodies who are viewed as “threatening” and are equally “threatened” is critical to creating a greater conversation. 

#### Expand

- Vincent Brown is the principal curator and investigator of the “Slave Revolt in Jamaica (1760-1761): A Cartographic Map”. He is the Charles Warren Professor of History and Professor of African and African-American Studies at Harvard University. The map, which can be found [here](http://revolt.axismaps.com/map/) is incredible. One can look at a map of locations or terrain. There are over 30 dates one can look at to see specific stages of the revolt. The map also includes animation illustrating travel patterns of various troops. 

#### Comment

- In response to @moninatalie’s question, I think that there are people who align with both sides (those who purposely forget the past and those who believe the past doesn’t matter) in the context of Black history. Both are equally problematic. There is a high likelihood that those who believe the past doesn’t matter hardly learned about the past. Certain law makers, politicians and or political figures who conveniently “forget” the past are consequently able to ignore the years of struggle that caused blacks to be amongst the most marginalized in America. These two groups feed off each other, and usually have more representation than those who recognize and understand the past (and present).  Therefore, issues are continuously suffocated and suppressed. 

#### Question

- Since few of us have the time to create detailed accounts of Black historical events, what can we do to humanize and spread knowledge of the Black experience?
- What sources have you used in the past (for any type of research or work) that have differed from the run of the mill textbook or document? Did you find it helpful? 
- How does (or doesn’t) the Afrofuturist movement humanize Blacks? What is its significance today?
