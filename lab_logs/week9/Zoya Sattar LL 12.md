### Overview
* Lev Manovich, “Database as a Genre of New Media.” 
Manovich works to explain the emergence of databases as the new voice of media. He also looks to determine the difference, importance, and prevalence of narratives and database in this new day and age. He ends with his view on what he believes to be now obsolete narratives in new media, advocating for us to stop linking databases and narratives. 
* Eltis, David, and David Richardson. “A New Assessment of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.” 
This book brings forth the idea that we are 'on the brink of reconstruction of the history of the transatlantic slave trade'. This is primarily due to a refocusing of scholars and historians, as well as the general public, on the atrocity that was the slave trade that has mostly been swept under the rugs. This uncovering comes from the vast amounts of information that have been able to be recovered and generated regarding the slave trade. 
* The H-Net Gorée Debate 
A series of emails between various professors at universities around the country discuss fallacies of history that the general population has latched on to. Going through instances such as the 'House of Slaves' in Gorree, and the obsession with numbers to produce some form of overall tragedy, the professors lament over the fact that history focuses on the wrong things for the wrong reasons.
* Carrie Mae Weems - From Here I Saw What Happened, And Cried
An art exhibition on everything black people were, are, and can be through Weems eyes. Her 33-photo progression of slave portraits to civil rights era stills with everything in between work to encompass the African American narrative Each portrait has sections of a poem scribbled over, perhaps speaking to the adversity of black Americans considering their history in this country.

### Reflection
I found Manovich's article interesting in light of our class discussion on Tuesday over what we consider to be data and databases.

I'd love for certain segments of the American population to read David and Richardson's line that the Americas were initially re peopled with Africans and not Europeans, given that there were 4 Africans for every European arriving in the Americas. This is especially due to many politicians working oh so hard for what they consider to have always been the majority in America: white people descended from Europeans. I never really think about how historians gather the data that's presented in our history books, or in papers, or used in discussion and presentations. David and Richardson do a great job and detailing the process in finding and utilizing this historical information with modern day tools. 

I recall Carrie Mae Weems' exhibition from the beginning of the semester, and I am still stunned every time I go through the photos.

The Debate piece spoke to how Gorree was more of a picturesque and emotional place, rather than a serious monument to the horrors of history. I feel that this is how my generation works with every aspect of life- if we cannot find beauty in an object, conventional or otherwise, we will throw it to the side without a second thought as it does not speak to our 'aesthetic'.

A series of portraits that take modern day characters and scenarios that one would have never thought to see in the colonial period, and have them dressed in the clohtes of their oppressors in history.
### Comment
To answer Tejiri's second question on narratives in the media being considered replaceable, it might be due to the sheer number of various narratives encompassed on various platforms throughout the Internet. As the human brain is not too good at thinking in terms of billions or trillions of entries, we are unable to register the full scope of narratives and thus delegate to a lower position in new media. 
### Questions
* Would there be different reactions to seeing Weems' exhibit online as opposed to in person?
* Are numbers utterly pointless when it comes to trying to calculate the magnitude of the Slave Trade?
* Will we eventually come up with a new term to describe data in the new world beyond just as databases?
