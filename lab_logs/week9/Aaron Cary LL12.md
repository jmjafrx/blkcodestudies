Lev Manovich, “Database as a Genre of New Media.”
Manovich describes database as a format of expression, explaining its role in expressing information in the modern age and relation to the prior expressive form, narrative. Databases have taken the form of a range of interfaces such as CDs, websites, and other formats that allow user interaction.

**David Eltis and David Richardson. “A New Assessment of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.”**
Eltis and Richardson discuss the modern understanding of the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the wake of updated data figures.

**The H-Net Gorée Debate**
This copy of a debate on an African History-themed listserve highlights a dissonance between historians over the significance of “House of Slaves,” in Goree, and more deeply highlights disagreements over the prioritization of numbers and empiricism.

Philip Curtin opens, explaining that the “House of Slave’s” curator falsely claimed that millions of slaves had been sold from Goree and the public had been duped into attributing false significance to Goree’s role in the slave trade. Critics argue that by only attributing significance to numbers, that the symbolic significance is eschewed.  

**Carrie Mae Weems - From Here I Saw What Happened, And Cried**
This gallery of toned prints examines a history of mistreatment that blacks have faced from the sympathetic perspective of female African figure.

Reflection
----------

A lot of the Goree Debate came across as petty, like stumbling on a private email chain, but some of the closing remarks by Paul Landau and John Boldrick help succinctly reinforce the value of empiricism in history. This argument for uncovering and data reminds me of Sarah Patterson’s “Toward Meaning-Making in the Digital Age: Black Women, Black Data and Colored Conventions.”

I think Manovich’s piece can be best summed up by the film Arrival. But seriously, databases offer a chance to look at events non-linearly, which is an advantage over the narrative form. And in that case isn’t it a disservice to the potential of the database format to visualize the data in a timeline format like the Slave Revolt in Jamaica?

Comment
-------

To JB’s question  “Do you think digital history will become mainstream in academia? What are some challenges that digital historians and archivists will have to overcome?” I think so. It offers students a familiar interface through which they can interact with a subject matter that can feel inherently distant. The challenge is the interpretation of the data and the context given. Students must be very careful to avoid fallacies when handling data sets with implications as important as the trans-Atlantic slave trade, for example.

Question
--------

1. What is the greater significance of the female figure that bookends Carrie Mae Weems’ gallery?
2. What sources are historians unearthing that offer updated numbers like in the Eltis-Richardson reading? Where are they coming from?
