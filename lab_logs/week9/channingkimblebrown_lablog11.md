## Lab Log #11 | Channing Kimble-Brown

### Overview

**"Mapping a Slave Revolt Visualizing Spatial History through the Archives of Slavery"**

* Vincent Brown writes about how historians that want more people in the general public to engage with the subject matters that they research. He feels like historians need to learn to value more traditional methods of researching and presenting finding since they are the foundation of fields like Digital Humanities, which too often tries to distance itself from regular history. But he also feels like historians must learn to embrace new, more tech-oriented ways of presenting information that is more likely to hold the attention of the average internet user. This also includes collaborating across more fields of study than ever before.

**"Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)"**

* Shannon Egan discusses a set of images created by Kara Walker that were created to counter the idea that the history of the Civil War should be told without condemning the actions of any particular men as wrong, on either side. Her images force people to reconcile the factual, analytical view of what happened and the more violent an horrific aspects by overlaying traditional, neutral Civil War paintings with silhouettes of black caricatures. Walker very much wanted to play with the idea that black people in the present are the products of the traumas that their ancestors experienced and that those traumas continually shape black people's perception.

### Reflection

The first piece by Brown was interesting because it's something that software engineers struggle with as well, but from a much less... altruistic motivation. In order to make money companies do everything they can to get people to stay on their sites longer, how to keep people engaged. But then we end up with the problem of websites supporting violent trolling and harassment because public displays of hurting marginalized users draws and holds the attention of large numbers of people. The second piece by Egan was also really cool because I really liked how she explained the trauma that black people carry with them from previous generations. It's impossible to grow up in our culture as a black person without having your understanding of the world being heavily affected by the historical oppression of black people. It affects how you interact with others, how they interact with you, the opportunities you have in life and your ability to take advantage of the ones you get or forge your own.

The idea of people like Spicer refusing to call racism, anti-semitism, hate crimes and terrorism by white supremacists what they are. He somehow tried turned this hate crime into a condemnation of the left for assuming that someone from the right committed this kind of crime, failing to ever actually engage with the fact that a white man murdered a black man in the name of white supremacy. This reminds me of how Guernsey and Alden seem to feel like you should pretend like the wrongs committed by every party in the civil war should be treated equally and discussed impassionately to have any legitimacy. The way that Spicer seems to think everyone should be called out, Guernsey and Alden think that no one should be called out, and both tactics erase the very real harm that was done.

### Comment

In regards to Turquoise's [first question](https://github.com/blackcodestudies/blkcodestudies/blob/master/lab_logs/week9/turquoisebaker_LL11.md), I think a lot of the work is being done for us. There are activists, historians, sociologists, etc. working constanstly to understand black experiences past and present and figure out how to present those ideas in ways that apply to our everyday lives, and I think that it is the responsibility of those of use that may not have the time, resources, or know-how to share the work that is being done and to protect them from push-back.

### Question

1. Why do you think people have so much less patience for web pages than written text?
2. Is celebrity endorsement the only way to spread interest, however fleeting, in important historical information on a large scale?
3. Do you agree with Kara Walker that black people are a "container for specific pathologies of the past", growing and feeding off those maladies? If you agree, do you think that there will ever be a time that this is no longer true?
