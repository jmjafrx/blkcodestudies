Lab Log 12

# Overview: 

### Lev Manovich, “Database as a Genre of New Media.”

Lev disuccsues the modern database and its incoherence. Because digital databases are usually collections of unrelated information and are constantly modified, there is little continuity or narrative involved. There are two forms of software: databases and algorithms. Databases are organized bits of information. Algorithms are systems that dictate how to conduct specific tasks or deal with specific inputs. These descriptions are used to understand what place narratives have in a database world.

### Eltis, David, and David Richardson. “A New Assessment of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.”

The authors open with a discussion of the “explosion of interest” in the transatlantic slave trade. Technological progress and the effort of academics worldwide helped to codify tons of data on the sale trade into two databases—TSTD1 and TSTD2. There is a whirlwind tour of the databases and individuals analysis of different import and export countries. The author then describes how he will apply the data from these two databases to various topics addressed later in the book.

### The H-Net Gorée Debate

This is an email chain of some sort wherein various academics discuss the truth behind Goree Island. One historian believes millions of slaves were exported from this island, while another thinks it was less than 30,000. A Penn professor says the numbers are not important, because the Goree Island slave house is a monument to death at the hands of slavery, not an accurate totem. The professors debate qualitative and quantitative approaches to history and challenge each other to consider what information is deemed valuable in the context of Goree Island.

### Carrie Mae Weems - From Here I Saw What Happened, And Cried

This is a series of red-toned portraits of mostly black subjects overlaid with a poem. The portraits’ subjects range from clothed to nude, young to old, groups to individuals. The poem is a recounting of the laundry list of black struggles, as seen by a woman who may not have left Africa. The cool blue portrait that bookends the series symbolizes that woman looking down on her descendants, surveying their conditions, and crying. 

# Reflect:

Lev Manovich’s article challenged me. Besides the fact that it is laden with typos, awkward phrasing, and jargon, Lev manages to complicate what is otherwise a simple relationship between data, algorithms, and narratives.The Elis reading opens the door on the development of indexed databases capable of informing historical analysis and was interesting in its rapid iteration. The Goree debate was sadly petty, like a comment-war on social media where each successive post nitpicks the language of the last. Through my reading of the email chain, it was apparently that some elite professors enjoy making mountains out of anthills. Regardless, it seems that a debate remains on the value of a monument versus the moment’s actual significance in the context of the memorialized event. Carrie Mae Weem’s art was a beautiful refresher after that petty-party! She served lovely photography with beautiful, but not too overt, symbolism. The captions felt like laundry list of black struggles, seen from the perspective of someone who escaped capture in Africa.

# Expand:

I highly recommend “Database of Dreams: Forgotten Archive of How to Be Human” by Rebecca Lemov. It’s got nothing to do with this class but is another interesting discussion of databases.

# Comment:

I’d like to respond to JB’s question about digital media. I think the internet is the new home of history, where everything is automatically converted to data and indexed without any extra work. Future historians may have more complex questions such as which data they have access to, who owns it, and who truly authored it.

# Question:
1. Who has the rights to the information in these databases? Are they “secure”—whatever that might mean.
2. Why can a narrative not comprise data from a database? A narrative is, after all, a serious of events that could be translated as data.
3. What does the woman in blue represent in Carrie Mae Weem’s work?
