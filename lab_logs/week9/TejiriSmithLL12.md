# Overview

* Lev Manovich, “Database as a Genre of New Media.”

In this online article Lev Manovich discusses the dichotomy of databases and narratives in media. They begin by making the distinction that narratives follow a line and have purpose, while a database is a collection of items, with presumably no path to follow. After this distinction is made Manovich draws CD-ROM games into the conversation and explains that they are not only databases, but algorithms of data, almost an applied database. Manovich then explains that the very existence of the internet, or millions of databases (websites), dwarfs the magnitude of narratives in the media, begging the question of how they still exist in new media. 


* Eltis, David, and David Richardson. “A New Assessment of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.” In Extending the Frontiers: Essays on the New Transatlantic Slave Trade Database, edited by Eltis, David and Richardson, David, 1–62. Yale University Press, 2008.

In this book the authors begin with an explanation of why the discussion on the Transatlantic Slave Trade has increased dramatically, explaining that a huge influx of data came after 1999 becuase of the fact that the Transatlantic Slave Trade was thoroughly documented on a global scale. There is a public database online hosted by Emory and Hull universities thanks to the hard work of thousands of historians and scholars, and essentially all of this information was compiled into two databases that are continuously referenced throughout the chapter: TSTD1 and TSTD2. The author describes in detail the logistics and data of many aspects of the slave trade concerning many different regions, British Carribean, Dutch, Spanish Americas, and Brazil, just to name a few. The author then prepares the reader for the rest of the book by giving a short synopsis of the three parts the book is broken into, these being Origins and Destinations, National Slave Trades, and Some Wider Consequences and Implications of New Data.


* The H-Net Gorée Debate

In what seemed to be an email thread between various professors at presitigous institutions there was a discussion of Goree, or "The House of the Slaves," in Senegal. There was a common consensus that the inaccurate promoting of Goree being a place where "tens of millions" of slaves passed through before leaving the continent of Africa forever was something that needed to be addressed among historians and scholars as an insult to integrity. What Richard Lobban called "the numbers game," or the obsession to quanitfy history, was also in discussion, along with a poorly worded comparison to the Holocaust. 


* Carrie Mae Weems - From Here I Saw What Happened, And Cried

In an online exhibition of one of Carrie Mae Weems' there are 33 portraits of black people with a sections of a poem scribed on top of them. The pictures range from aged, topless women to soldiers in uniform to a scarred back, all expect for the first and last have an oval overlay with red film placed over them. The first picture is a woman with a headpiece looking straight ahead with a cool blue film placed over her, the last picture is the same thing except she is reveresed, looking back at the 31 portraits and her twin. 


# Reflection

After reading these discussions on databases I'm only just now realizing the magnitude of databases and their many different faces. After class Tuesday I thought about how much information one would have to ask themselves in the creation of the visualization project that Vincent Brown decribed and it still didn't hit me then until reading the description of the TSTD1 and TSTD2. The chapter of this book really only briefly explained the different regions involved in the Transatlantic Slave Trade, but it took me quite a long time to read through all of it. The sheer mass of data that was in only a little over 50 pages of reading made my head swim, and then thinking about the fact that it all had to be compared in order to avoid repeats of voyages was even more dizzying. The various types of databases that exist is something that really shocks me and can't help but make me think about the data on other subjects concerning black people.

I am now going to think of this [girl's Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Kieraplease/media) as a database of all of her cosplay, please make your day better by checking it out.


# Comment 

In response to Megan's question: Is Kara Walker's work icoinc or repressive, I genuinely do not know how her work could ever been as "repressive" in any way. Jarring, uncomfortable, inapproriate even, but repressive? I don't even think black women are allowed to be seen as repressive according to the stereotype that has been built up for centuries. We have been constantly been seen as exotic, over-sexual, and borderline animalistic, and nowhere in any of those descriptions does the word repressive fit as a synonym. So given the two options, I would say that Walker's work is iconic ten times over. 


# Questions

* Do the professors who felt that the numerification of the Transatlantic Slave Trade would always be incorrect still feel the same way after seeing the TSTD1 and 2? I know their discussion was several years before the massive influx of records so I'm curious as to what their response to that book would be.

* Why did Manovich have a hard time believing that narrative and database could coexist? What makes narrative in the media so replacable, especially at this time?

* Has Carrie Mae Weems ever come out and acknowledged that Goree Island was not as pivotal in the slave trade as she was lead to believe? Is her photography still historically relevant now that we know this information?
