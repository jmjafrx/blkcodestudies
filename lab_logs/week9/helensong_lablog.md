## Overview

Vincent Brown discusses archiving and communicating history through technology, specifically discussing the history of slavery and the enslaved, and how much of it still lacks in-depth, accessible information. He points to his own project, *Slave Revolt in Jamaica*, and how cartographic visualization of events helps to present these ideas to students, researchers, teachers, and etc. However, he also notes the limitations and flaws of this kind of historical presentation because using British maps still reifies colonial geography, and he further emphasizes the importance of still focusing on historical research through primary sources.

Shannon Egan's article focuses on Kara Walker, an African-American female artist who is renowned for her art that confronts racism and sexism in historical and contemporary contexts. Egan specifically analyzes Walker's silhouette pieces that depict black bodies during the antebellum era, which depict the horrors done to black people at the time.

The Seventeen Men: Portraits of Black Civil War Soldiers exhibit at the Evergreen Museum is self-explanatory from its title. However, it is significant in that it brings attention to ordinary soldiers in the civil war who are often forgotten. The portraits are accompanied by long, in-depth descriptions of the soldiers' lives.

##Reflection

I previously have never really thought about artwork as data or coding, but this perspective on Kara Walker's work along with Brown's article has definitely expanded my views on what constitutes as data. Especially in the context of a history of slavery and oppression, where information is often lacking or suppressed, the presentation of history in the forms of maps, art, portraits, etc. become essential. I was especially struck by Kara Walker's art in how it can depict stereotypes but also confront them simultaneously.

## Expand

I am a voracious lover of art, and although I wasn't previously as familiar with Kara Walker's work, her work reminds me of Kehinde Wiley's resplendent portraits, as well as Kenyatta AC Hinkle's works. Kehinde Wiley portrays contemporary black men in renaissance style portraits, while Hinkle takes 19th and 20th century West African photographs taken mainly by French colonialists and reimagines them in her art.

## Comment
I wanted to talk about JB's question "What is the importance of re-imagining history in the manner that Kara Walker does? What historical moments could use such a treatment?" I think that the reclaiming images of black bodies by African American artists and historians is essential because we are constantly seeing black people from the eyes of white people in photographs, historical accounts, drawings/paintings, etc. By letting African American artists reimagine and recreate these images, we are finally seeing representation of black people these historical eras through the eyes of other black people. 



## Question
 
1. How important is it it to make data accessible to all people? Is it important enough to sacrifice the depth of the researched information?
2. What does it mean when African American artists portray stereotypes? 
3. What are ways data in the form of art, exhibits, interactive websites, etc. can help change the way we discuss certain topics/mainstream discourse?
