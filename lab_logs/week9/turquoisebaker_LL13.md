#### Overview

Handler, Jerome S., and Annis Steiner. "Identifying Pictorial Images of Atlantic Slavery: Three Case Studies." Slavery & Abolition 27, no. 1 (2006): 51–71. 

- In this article, Jerome S. Handler and Annis Steiner note that illustrations used in publications about the Transatlantic Slave Trade (which are increasing in number) use and buy illustrations taken from secondary sources with “inadequate and misleading at best and inaccurate at worst” bibliographic information on the images (51). A researcher is therefore unable to distinguish between an image drawn as a direct portrait, a copy, or even an artist’s imagination. Steiner and Handler include various examples of illustrations used commonly in publications out of context, including an illustration of a slave coffle featured in Charles Livingstone’s Narrative of an Expedition (1865), an anonymous image entitled Africans Thrown from Slave Ship, and Brazilian Slave, drawn by Jacques Arago, whose image has been interpreted and even edited to align with assertions of various slave publications. The authors conclude that “images do not ‘speak for themselves’” and that context, just as for written history, is critical to fully understand them (63). 

Morgan, Jennifer L. "'Some Could Suckle over Their Shoulder:' Male Travelers, Female Bodies, and the Gendering of Racial Ideology, 1500-1770." The William and Mary Quarterly 54, no. 1 (January 1, 1997): 167–192. 

- Morgan begins by introducing the reader to Englishman Richan Ligon, who traveled to be a planter in the Barbados colony in 1647. His written accounts upon first seeing a black woman were centered on her physical appearance (“or the greatest beauty and majesty together”) (167). Later on, Ligon’s writings on black women spoke to their large stature which “symbolized their sole utility--their ability to produce both crops and other laborers” (168). Ligon and other Europeans travelled precariously on the line between monstrous and repulsive, “productive and reproductive, beautiful and black” (170). Nonetheless, Jennifer L. Morgan argues that these sentiments stemmed from pre-conceived European notions of human hierarchy and difference (170). The obsession phenotypic attributes such as sagging breasts and dark skin and the grotesque sexualization of black women led to the depiction of the black woman as a monstrosity as early as the 14th century. The sounds of African language, shame (or lack thereof), and child care were all factors used by various European individuals to (disturbingly) “determine” levels of allure, savagery, and sexual potential of black women.

“Interview: Kara Walker Decodes Her New World Sphinx at Domino Sugar Factory.” Complex. 

- This is a transcript of an interview between Kara Walker and Antwaun Sargent about Walker’s breathtaking work, A Subtlety. After accepting the challenge of using the Domino sugar factory, Walker spent eight months deciding on various ideas. The piece, Walker states, speaks to “the continuing presence of the commodities produced by slaver, which are produced in circumstances that aren’t too different from slavery”.  The position of the “political sugar sculpture” an over 35-foot-tall woman-like sphinx, is dominant and submissive, “but she [the sphinx] is so large that she could only dominate”. An atmosphere of domination is also apparent by the hand gesture of the large sugar sculpture, which, depending on where in Portugal one is from, can mean either “good luck” or “fuck you”. Kara Walker, at the time of this interview, was unsure of what would be next for here, but assures Sargent that she is “capable of doing whatever the hell [she wants]”. 

#### Reflection

- The sexualization and fetizisation of black women has been the source of an unjustifiable amount of violence, physical and psychological, towards black women around the globe. I enjoyed Jennifer L. Morgan’s article because she refused to look at this phenomenon at its face value, accentuating the centuries old rhetoric that supports this mode of thought. I would have liked her to speak to actual interactions between black women and Europeans, rather than primarily focusing on literary accounts of their phenotypic and “monstrous” appearance and attributes. Nonetheless, her historical background on the matter was well written and compelling. 

#### Expand

- This week’s readings reminded me of the “The Doll Tests”: trials created in the 1940s (and still replicated today) by psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark. In this test, children ages three to seven were presented with four dolls differing only in skin color, and asked to state the race of each doll and which doll they preferred. A majority of the children found the lighter-skinned dolls more preferable. The results were so profound (and disturbing) that they were infamously used in Brown v. Board of Education, and referenced in other trials

For a video from CNN about a variation of same test (in which over 70% of older black children, when asked “the one you think most children would think looks bad on a boy”, chose the darkest skin tones presented to them), with Anderson Cooper, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQACkg5i4AY) The video is just over five minutes. I really recommend watching it. 

#### Comment

- In response to Meghan’s question, I don’t think we can prevent data from being interpreted the “wrong” way, but I think we can work publicize the most comprehensive understanding of data. The difficult part, I believe, in getting people to believe and understand these interpretations (in a Black History Studies context) is dealing with the active silencing of many of the “correct” or “comprehensive” interpretations. “Big things” like creating an over 35-foot-tall sugar sculpture, or “smaller things” like speaking about other dimension of data, can help to combat the shallow interpretations of data. 

#### Question

- How can we show that “beauty” does not discriminate based on race (and other categories), especially to young kids?

- Should there be restrictions on image use in school textbooks and educational publications without proper source information, or does the value of having the images in the first place exceed the value of correctly citing them? 

- How does violence against black women manifested itself now versus in the 1400s? Are there similarities? Differences? Trends?
