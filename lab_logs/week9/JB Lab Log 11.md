**Overview**

*Egan Reading*

Shannon Egan explores Kara Walker’s controversial re-imagining of Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War. The original publishers of the book omitted Black existence from its images of Civil War America. Clearly, Black bodies were important to the war cause as actors in resistance Southern resistance and Union savior complex and as victims of the war. Egan argues that Walker’s aim in recreating or rather creating these images of Black life in places of their omission in to establish a link between the Black Americans life of the contemporary moment with injuries from a historical past. 

One image that Walker reconstructs is Occupation of Alexandria. The photograph captures a Union brigade storming the city of Alexandria, Virginia. Union soldiers stormed and pillaged the city, setting it ablaze, claiming a US victory and causing residents (whites and slaves) to flee for their lives. In the original illustration, viewers only notice the white residents fleeing or greeting Union soldiers. There is no indication that Black life existed. Walker re-imaging of the Occupation includes two Black figures, a man and woman. Both are reacting to the blaze that covered the city. The woman balls her fist to the sky as if to curse a deity for her existence and current state. The man flees from the city, presumably from the fire, but perhaps as an opportunity to escape slavery or both. These figures are faceless, nameless, but still convey emotions of fear, pain and again because of their condition. Walker rejects the stereotypical depictions of slaves that one may find in other illustration in the Harper’s history of the Civil War. Egan concludes that Walker’s new prints “disrupts” the original Harper’s illustration by redefining a historical archive that intentionally omitted Black bodies. 

*Brown Reading*

Vincent Brown discusses the necessity of digital history to reclaim narratives of the Black experience, particularly narratives of slave revolts. Brown focuses on the Jamaican slave revolts of 1760-1761. Before providing a short account of the revolts, Brown explains how traditional historiography of slavery have a depressing, lackluster or uninspiring database of slave revolts, a void of sorts. He discusses an incident at a digital humanities conference where historians largely omitted discussions on slavery. While these omissions are unfortunate, Brown writes that these absences present an opportunity for historians to reimagine history. Brown examines movements of slave resistance during the Jamaican slave uprising. He uses cartography to understand spatial history and trace movements of guerilla rebels. Cartography offers historians a great way to conduct research, pose questions, and reveal relations. 

A poignant reference that Brown includes is Michel-Trouillot’s thought on silences in history. Trouillot argues that historical knowledge is a result of power. In the context of the omission of Sans-Souci from the historiography of the Haitian Revolution, Troulliot finds that history’s victories intentional construct historical narratives that reflect their understanding of historical events. Silences are intentional and should not be overlooked in historiographies.


**Reflection**

I thought Brown took too long to reference the Jamaican revolts. He offers too much theory that made reading his article a bit tedious. I thought his discussion of the revolts was insightful, but short and a bit underwhelming. I had an expectation that Brown would provide details on the slave revolt through a discussion of his mapping of the resistance movement. Considering the theme of this week’s classes, I wanted to more read about acts of violence against white rule and less on the process of developing new history on a resistance movements.

**Comment**

In response to Zoya’s first question, I think schools are moving toward integrating tech into all curriculums. It is impossible to not include technology is historical research. I think that though this class, we have learned of the importance of Twitter as an archival database for contemporary resistance movements.

Here’s an article weighing the pros and cons of controversial art from the New York Times. Kara Walker is referenced, but the article came out of the recent outrage over a white artist’s painting of Emmitt Till’s open casket. 




**Questions**

1. What is the importance of re-imagining history in the manner that Kara Walker does? What historical moments could use such a treatment?

2. Do you think digital history will become mainstream in academia? What are some challenges that digital historians and archivists will have to overcome? 

3. The photographs of Black Union soldiers at the Evergreen Museum existed in a family’s possession for over 150 years. What does their omissions from prior Civil War exhibits say about Black inclusion in Civil War historiography? What does their omissions say about the Union’s perception of the importance of Black bodies during the war?
