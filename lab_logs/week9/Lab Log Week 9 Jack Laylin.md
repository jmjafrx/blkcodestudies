# Overview: 

### Brown, Vincent. “Mapping a Slave Revolt Visualizing Spatial History through the Archives of Slavery.”

Vincent Brown believes that it is the responsibility of Black digital humanities academics to probe available data and synthesize new visualizations in order to shape faithful discourse in the future. Brown also cautions scholars to not reify imbalances in history through their graphical depictions of data and analysis. He cites one cartographic example that describes a guerrilla uprising. The map uses colonial geography, European plotting mechanisms, and flattened graphics that don’t pay respect to the context of the uprising and its agents. Brown also acknowledges the limitations of data available and the underdevelopment of processes that would allow for a more faithful representation of slave revolts and black history at large.

### Egan, Shannon, "Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)" (2013). Schmucker Art Catalogs.

Egan analyze’s Kara Walker’s art, which appropriates civil war images and superimposes the silhouettes of black bodies. The bodies are presented according to black stereotypes, which Egan thinks references pseudo-scientific physiognomy in a subversive fashion. Walker “infiltrates narratives of American history” with her juxtaposition of detailed, masculine, hawkish drawings and stark black bodies that defy race and gender expectations. 

### Seventeen Men: Portraits of Black Civil War

This exhibition shows the portraits if 17 black soldiers from the civil war. It’s a tribute to the “ordinary” people of the civil war who fought the same fight as their more famous brothers. Each portrait is accompanied by more detailed biographical information about the subject.

# Reflect:

Vincent Brown has a pragmatic take on the responsibility of black historians to fairly evaluate history. We aren’t always given the foundations and resources to complete a project to this highest ideal standards. This is especially true to the histories of minorities. Data, where collected, is probably incomplete. Traditions of cartography or illustration or language might be less explored and codified than their western European counterparts. Kara Walker’s art is particularly impactful, and I appreciate her demonstrated honesty about stereotypes and her awareness of audience. 

# Expand:

Kara Walker’s art reminds me of Kehinde Wiley’s transposition of black bodies and stories into contexts that evoke renaissance-era paintings. One of my favorite pieces is below.

# Comment:

Ellie asked about Kara Walker’s “racist pathologies.” I think the artist wants her work to be a black woman’s reclamation of the pejorative stereotypes she has faced her whole life. By reclaiming it, she is destabilizing its ownership by the white man and, consequently, its power.

# Question:
1. Should academia focus on a greater volume of black historiographical representation or a more faithful and less euro-centric model?
2. How can we expect digital humanists to adopt methods of representation that aren’t well taught or documented? 
3. When does Kara Walker’s depiction of the black body, even in silhouette, transform from a subversive image to a pejorative caricature?
