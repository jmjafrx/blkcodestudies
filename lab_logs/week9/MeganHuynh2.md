# Overview
Carrie Mae Weems: This photographic album is mostly of portraits of Black men, women, and children who symbolize how the Black body has been manipulated, taken advantage of, fetishized, destroyed, and so on. The view of the gallery is first a bluish photograph of a African woman, perhaps a mother, a symbol of what the peaceful African life was before it went to America, peering into the black and red photos of the mutilated Black bodies. 
Database as a Genre of New Media: This article discussed how everything on the Internet has become a database of interconnected websites that host and share much of the same information. Secondly, Manovich discusses how the terms database and narrative have different definitions than it does in the computer culture. In new media, databases can be taken at face value, in which the information presented is not interpreted in any other form than facts or it can be taken itself in a narrative that can interpret the data in something completely different.
H-Net Debate: An email chain between Professors discussing the historical role of Goree’s slave house in the slave trade. They go back and forth on the meaning of numbers in the trans-atlantic slave trade and how those numbers can mislead assumptions about the accuracy of the history behind the slave trade. 
A New Assessment of the Transatlantic Slave Trade: This article discusses how the Transatlantic slave trade was a new human phenomenon because for the first time, the transportation of slaves was not considered morally wrong. The human rights aspect of slave trade was considered unimportant compared to the economic and personal gains made through the price of other’s lives. In addition, the article discusses a 2001 attempt to reassess the slave trade’s actual size. 
# Reflection
The importance of data in the context of Black history is incredibly important. In many of our discussions, the root of all the social, economic, cultural, and even political issues in America stem from the results of slavery. In a similar vein, data can be a reiteration of the injustices during slavery through numbers. By going back, collecting correct and significant data that is unbiased, the data for slavery can lead to better and more accurate data for practices in archiving modern Black history.

This article directly relates to what we were discussing about in terms of creating a database and archiving our digital work in order to portray information the way we want people to see it. In addition, it also relates to our discussions about surveillance and how information in cyberspace is never confidential, never safe, and 

# Comment
In response to Teijiri: “Why did Manovich have a hard time believing that narrative and database could coexist? What makes narrative in the media so replacable, especially at this time?” 
I think it’s because of Manovich’s definition of what database and narrative means. To Manovich, essentially, narrative means a story. More often than not, people make whatever story they want to say about data. This practice is even common in science. If a scientist conducts an experiment, and a reaction that they expected happens, they’ll interpret the data the way the assumptions that drove the experiment established. 
# Questions
1.	The argument of the true numbers of the transatlantic slave trade seem to be contested very often. How do textbooks choose what numbers they want to represent in their books?
2.	How can you prevent data from being interpreted the “wrong” way?
3.	Many of the art we’ve seen seem to say “look what the white man did to us.” How can people rectify the hurt that occurred during slavery?
