### Overview
* Handler, Jerome S., and Annis Steiner. "Identifying Pictorial Images of Atlantic Slavery: Three Case Studies." 
Handler believes that historians that attempt to acquire images of the Atlantic Slave Trade from photo houses/libraries do not place as much importance on researching or referencing the contexts in which these pictures were taken. This allows for the perpetuation of historical and bibliographical errors in the documentation of pictures from this time. The authors use three different portraits to emphasize their point.
* Morgan, Jennifer L. "'Some Could Suckle over Their Shoulder:' Male Travelers, Female Bodies, and the Gendering of Racial Ideology, 1500-1770."
Focuses on the portraying of women in colonized populations as merely objects to be used for labour and the generation of offspring. Opening with a quote from an Englishman, Richard Ligan''s first encounter with a black woman is overridden with shock at their attractiveness. His lauding of their beauty however rapidly shifts to a sexualization of every fiber of their being. The shifting view and value of coloured womens bodies in the eyes of the colonizers also reflected the shifting borders of continuous colonization, 
* “Interview: Kara Walker Decodes Her New World Sphinx at Domino Sugar Factory.”
This interview goes over Kara Walker's process of creating the piece, how it links the past and future in the present space that is a sugar factory along with all its historical conotations, and how such an exhibit can work forward into the future after being dismantled. Going from what started her on this exhibition, to how she got the ideas and ability to pull through with it, to how she hopes it will affect those who visit- the interview is full of valuable information on an artist's creative process while attempting to overthrow the neo-colonial mindset. 
### Reflection
In Kara Walker's piece, she speaks to the difficulty of refining sugar to make it the fine white blend I am accustomed to. As happens often enough in this class, I was dumbstruck with the forgotten realization that sugar does not actually appear white in its pure form. And then comes the turning over of thoughts in my head, linking this fact back to colonialism and racism and how something as simple as sugar is in actuality very sinister. 

After spending a few days throughout the semester focused on Kara Walker's *A Subtlety*, it was enjoyable to read a more in-depth article from the artist herself.

A major weapon wielded by Europan colonizers around the world was to dehumanize the colonzied world's women. By painting them as savages, as less than human, all the while remaining sexually arousing and exotic, was used in part to crush the spirits of those who would rebel, as well as exert their power over the European colonized nations.

Speaking of art. Kendrick Lamar. Humble. 'Nuff said.
### Comments
To answer Tejiri's third question of perceptions of black women vs other women of colour, the simplest way to put it would be what you said- black women are bad and other minorities are good. The complex answer would deal with explaining why, in so many aspects of life around the world, are other minority women of colour considered more desirable than black women 
### Questions
1. Are we as a society beginning to unlearn the oversexualization of black womens bodies?
2. Would researching to correct inaccurate histories of portraits be something only a verified historian can undertake?
3. Have there been any exhibitions similar to Kara Walker's recently?
