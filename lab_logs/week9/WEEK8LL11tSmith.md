* Brown, Vincent. “Mapping a Slave Revolt Visualizing Spatial History through the Archives of Slavery.” Social Text 33, no. 4 125 (December 1, 2015): 134–41.

In his discussion on the transformation or history and archives, Vincent Brown clearly voices not only the motive for historians who are trying to recover slave stories, but also the challenges these people face when dealing with adultered history. He begins with the importance of archives themselves and how history can be a direct reflection of power. He then emphasizes that visual and spatial history offer room for deep inspection of history as we know it,leading into the main problem there is when it comes to colonization and slavery. As he said very eloquently, "How can the cameraman purport to represent experience when taking a photograph of a painting of a statue?" (138). Or in other words, how can we, as scholars and archivists, know our the history that we are studying is the most accurate one? He answers this question by saying that establishing a relationship between visual expression and historical meaning will allow for a version of the past that voices all. 


* Egan, Shannon, "Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)" (2013). Schmucker Art Catalogs. Book 2.

In this book Shannon Egan analyzes and explains the possible motive behiknd Kara Walker's Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated). The book features some, if not all, of Walker's annotated work and offers some insight on why she felt this history needed to be included. Egan explains that Walker includes black silhouettes to offer a history that the original artists chose to omit, and how her work has elicited varied responses.

# Reflection

Reading the article by Vincent Brown on retrieving lost history and archives due to power made me think a lot about the importance of archival, specifically tweets on Twitter. Brown mentions the extreme difficulty present of capturing what has already been captured several times over, and how this method is inaccurate and erases voices, however with the archival of Twitter I don't think something like that could happen again. With our constant exposure to digital journaling it is easy to forget that without those tools humans are easily forgotton. The one goal that every single living species has is to live, and even further, to pass on their own biological makeup. With the use of technology and its archival, humans get to live for essentially forever, something that every other species only dreams of.

This [video of Bill Withers](http://justkeeponpersisting.tumblr.com/post/152497838192/biggiepoppa-c-ill-legalmexican-bill-withers) singing just reminded me of when we were talking about Prince and how some of his albums were only available to those who had bought the few records that were sold oh so long ago and seeing this video just reminded me to be  thankful of the information I have available to me.


# Comment 

Channing mentioned a point in the last lab log assignment about white people taking on the role of foreigner in science fiction (as opposed to black people), but in the context of this week's focus on archives, I would like to discuss white people and their foreignness throughout history. As we all know white people Manifest Destiny'ed their way through the continents of North America, Asia, Africa, South America, and Australia, making them the foreigner in every instance, and still being the minority race on a worldwide scale. However, archives and the history that told of the stories of the people with the most power says that this is not the perspective that we should be taking. I'm just interested in how the narrative became controlled so completely and was spread so efficiently. It's a scary idea to look back on because it begs the question: what else have we missed?


# Questions

* As I mentioned earlier, Twitter makes archvial of everyone's voice fairly easy, but is it still possible that this history gets rewritten as well? What would be the signs?

* When looking for these documents and archives that tell us the unheard story, where do historians go to find such information? If there isn't one huge database of information where do we know where to look?

* What becomes of the information if it gets found by someone who doesn't care to share it?
