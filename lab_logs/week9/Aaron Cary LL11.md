**Brown, Vincent. “Mapping a Slave Revolt Visualizing Spatial History through the Archives of Slavery.”**
Vincent Brown examines the implications and design of a database-powered visual archive of slave insurrections and conflicts in Jamaica. Brown notes that the use of cartography and a timeline helps offer users a better understanding of how these events through space and time and clearly shows the strategic thinking behind the revolts. The cartographic approach does have limits in that it is a British map that lacks representation of the “spatial schemas, landmarks and pathways” of the rebels. Brown argues for greater exploration into web interfaces that enhance historical study rigor through new representations.

**Egan, Shannon, "Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)"**
Shannon Egar describes Kara Walker’s lithograph series titled Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War which adds a layer of silhouetted black figures whose bodies portray stereotypical physical features. Walker plays with temporality by suggesting relationship between past and present through these silhouettes that disrupt and mar the original illustrations.

Reflection
----------

Kara Walker’s work seems to me the most salient example of a digital resonance that I’ve seen in this course. Her work specifically tackles stereotypes to usurp negative connotation and act as a stand-in for diasporic blackness across time. I think it’s become easy for an outside perspective to try to divorce the black experience today from that of slavery but Walker’s work goes a long way toward dispelling that.

Comment
-------

To Zoya’s question “Would it be beneficial to petition for schools to include for technological databases of history in their syllabus’?” I think it would be a huge benefit to see history in action. I think a lot of students simply absorb history from textbooks and never get the chance to apply an empirical attitude and interrogate sources.

Question
--------

* After testing the Slave Revolt In Jamaica site, what advantages can you note from this visual representation?
* Does the narrative format have a role in filling in the blanks that Vincent Brown highlights?
* How else have you seen artists manipulate temporality (i.e. Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War, anachronistic soundtracks, etc.)?
