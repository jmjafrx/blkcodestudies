#### Overview

Lev Manovich, “Database as a Genre of New Media.”

- In “Database as a Genre of New Media”, Manovich questions why media today favors databases. These new collection databases present the world in a new way, and consequently, with a new culture, which Manovich refers to as “a new symbolic form of a computer age”. The form also reflects the disorganized structure of the world itself. In one example, Manovich explains that real-time transmissions (radio shows, web shows etc.) on websites are components in a collection of data options on a website that can take you to multiple other digital locations. 

- There are new media objects, however, that are narratives, like video games, which have algorithms stringing the gamer along from one part of the game to another. Although the player may have choice as to where they will go, they are limited in number compared to the plethora of choices one can choose on a regular website. This algorithmic logic is what the player learns while playing the game. 

- Algorithms and data structures are the two (symbiotic) types of software objects and are mandated to computerize culture. Databases, where the software objects interact, are where the computer age grows. However, narratives are different. They must have at least one actor and at least one story. That being said, not everything a user does on a database makes a “narrative”. 

Eltis, David, and David Richardson. “A New Assessment of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.” In Extending the Frontiers: Essays on the New Transatlantic Slave Trade Database, edited by Eltis, David and Richardson, David, 1–62. Yale University Press, 2008.

- David Eltis and David Richardson, authors of “A New Assessment of the Transatlantic Slave Trade”, intend to uncover more information about the slave trade. With access to more information on the slave trade and (constantly) evolving technological means to store the information, ways to study the Trade increase exponentially. Creating a successful database of this information requires three things: organization, accessibly, and sustained attention to previous overlooked or understudied components of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. 

The H-Net Gorée Debate 

- The “House of Slaves” built in the mid to late 1770s for a “wealthy trader, who may or may not have kept a few slaves on the lower floor at some time”, is said to have been a major shipping point (1). Because of _exceedingly questionable_ claims by the house curator, Joseph N’Diaye, and others that 20, even 40 million slaves were shipped from the house, Goree has become a magnet for African-American tourists and, arguably, a complete scam. 
- This document is a series of emails between East Tennessee State University affiliates about Goree, a town on Africa’s western coast near present day Gambia and Senegal, and its actual significance in the Transatlantic Slave Trade. While some argue that numbers should not dictate the importance of the cite as a historical location, others contend that numbers are a critical factor, which historians cannot overlook. 

Carrie Mae Weems - From Here I Saw What Happened, And I Cried

- From Here I Saw What Happened and I Cried is a set of 33 toned prints. The first and last prints are mirrored images of a bare chested African woman with blue hues. The prints in between are images with red hues of various well-known images of Black men and women, some standing alone in a traditional portrait, others in groups or with children (one image is a shoe shining drawing/advertisement). The red-hued prints are in circular frames. Each frame is accompanied with a few lines from a story about how, in the eyes of their oppressors, “you” (Black people), have changed from the genesis of colonial slavery the present (1996).  

#### Reflection

- This week’s readings were more difficult for me to understand than others, since I am not used to reading about coding, technology and databases. I do, however, appreciate what goes into creating databases and algorithms, even though I don’t completely understand. Manovich’s discussion about algorithms and data structures reminded me of the conversation we had in class about analog vs. digital. I look forward to learning more to understand these concepts.
 
#### Expand

- (This is probably more related to Tuesday’s articles) The link [here](https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/myles-loftin-joyful-photos-confront-media-bias-against-black-male-teens) is an article on Myles Loftin’s “HOODED” photo series and film (embedded in article). Inspired by the 5th anniversary of Trayvon Martin’s death this February, Loftin’s project is meant to “deconstruct stereotypes surrounding black boys”. All Black men featured in the images and film are wearing bright colored hoodies, accompanied by vibrant background colors.

#### Comment

- In response to JB’s question, I think digital media will become more mainstream in academia. However, since there is an increase in history being made on digital platforms, I feel like this “history” will not be truly appreciated until we reach the point at which today’s digital advancements become outdated. Many already correlate value with antiquity. Digital archivists and historians may find it difficult to highlight the value of this “newer history”, especially in an era where so much of it is easily accessible for millions of people. 

#### Question
- The image after “You Became an Accomplice” in Carrie Mae Weems’ image set is of young girl overlaid with sheet music. Can anyone tell what the song is? (I don’t know)

- Databases, like the ones mentioned by Eltis and Richardson, are critical for our understanding of the past, but are not popular amongst those who would probably benefit from their contents. How can we make these databases more visible in the public eye? How can we communicate the importance of the material within them? 

- We have seen a lot of art in the past few weeks (Weems, Walker, BFAP etc.). Some create new concepts while others, notably Walker and Weems, add to relics of the past. Which do you find most impactful and why?
