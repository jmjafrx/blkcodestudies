**Lab Log 12**

Ellis and Richardson Reading

Ellis and Richardson evaluate and examine why new knowledge and research emerged in the late 1990s on the Transatlantic slave trade. There was an uncovering of information on slave routes, ports, and cargo that historians previously did not have access to in prior decades. Ellis and Richardson offer a description of other parts of their book.

Carrie Mae Seems Exhibition 

Carrie Mae Seems transformed 33 photographs of the Black experience into sentimental images capturing different moments of Black suffering. She begins and ends the gallery with a photo of woman who watches the suffering of Black people from enslavement through the assimilation of Black Americans in post-slavery American society. Each photo features a caption related to the image’s subject.

Goree Island Debate

Historians debated the importance of Goree Island to the transatlantic slave trade. Dr. Curtain of the Johns Hopkins University caused the most controversy, stating that Goree was not a central location in the West African trade. He claimed that it is likely no slaves passed through that house and it is more of a site of tourism that an artifact of actual history. He also is skeptical of the lack of consistent figures on the slaves who departed from Goree. The subsequent comments are responses to Dr. Curtain. There seems to be a divide over Goree’s purpose in the historiography of the West African slave trade. Some historians commented that Goree was merely a symbolic representation of the slave trade, while others argued for Goree’s central importance as a fact of the seizure and displacement of African people. 

Manovich Reading

Manovich describes the importance of databases in understanding and using new media objects and devices for research. Databases are a collection of information that allow users to navigate, view and search archival information. Manovich offers CD-ROMs as a popular form of database. CD-ROMs are encyclopedias. Webpages are also a collection of information as are website based on radio shows that archive former shows. 

**Reflection**

My favorite images from the Seems exhibition are captioned “You become playmate to the patriarch and their daughter.” In this series, a naked Black woman lays suggestively as if she is the concubine of a white male. In the next panel, another woman holds a white child suggesting that she’s the child’s primary caregiver, her nanny or Mammy. Both images highlight the white supremacist’s perception of Black women sexual objects for their pleasure and primary caregivers of their families. 

**Comment**

In response to Zoya’s second question, I do think numbers are pointless in calculating the magnitude of the slave trade. We know from the millions of people of African descent in the Americas that there were millions of Africans transported from them continent to the European colonies.

Some of you in the course maybe familiar with Faith Ringgold, a noted children’s author. Ringgold was a figure of the Black Arts Movement, an artistic period than ran analogous to the Black Power Movement. The image above is my favorite work of art from Ringgold. I learned of it yesterday in my African American literature course. 


**Questions**

1. What do you make of Professor Loubbon’s comparison of the importance of Goree Island to European concentration camps? Is it possible that his point was to explain that people of African descent must prove that their oppression existed for it to be legitimated while other ethnic groups’ oppression are more likely to be believed?

2. What were your favorite image featured in Carrie Mae Seems’ gallery and why?

3. How can digital historians better articulate their arguments on history and technology without giving too much attention to tech and historical theory while making their works more accessible to a wider audience?
