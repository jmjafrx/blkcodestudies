### Overview
* Brown, Vincent. “Mapping a Slave Revolt Visualizing Spatial History through the Archives of Slavery.” 
Rapid and phenomenal advances in technology have allowed for history to be preserved and retold on a global scale, in new forms that would have never been perceived as possible. Yet at the same time, the engagement of visitors with these historical exhibitions brought back to life are also shallow, with a lack of interest and/or passion for the importance of the past. Brown brings forth the argument that while a digital medium has been vastly important in modernizing history, far too many historians have fallen into the trap of regarding the medium to be more important than the content. 
* Egan, Shannon, "Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)" 
Walker's portraits use black figures superimposed over the original Harper prints to invoke fresh feelings of the horror and despair that African Americans in this country have continuously faced. Their pain has been largely erased or hiddem from history. Waller's works push the boundries of American history as it has traditionally been told.
* Evergreen Museum - Seventeen Portraits of Black Civil War Soldiers
This collection of portraits of free and enslaved blacks serving during the Civil War is held at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Historians worked hard to uncover the stories of each of the men depicted in these 17 portraits. 
### Reflection
This week's topic was coding black revolt. In the two pieces we had to read, both discussed how new mediums utilized through technology have quite literally coded black history. These readings focus on the revolution aspect of African American history, detailing their resistance to slavery with use use of modern-day tools. They brought forward some very valid and eye-opening points on how historical narratives have traditionally been written, and how the advancement in technology are allowing for history to be rewritten by those who were actually affected instead of being spoken for by white invaders.

Get Out has made history. It was the first horror movie in 13 years to break the $100 million mark, as well as a cultural and social phenomenon. I think the social horrors depicted in this movie are the beginning of a new wave of black revolt against the US racist everything system being encoded into a relatively form of media- the movie screen.
### Comment
To answer Larsen's first question, I would like to think I would not have supported the trade deal even if it would have meant saving my family. But of course, no one truly knows how strong their morals are until they are put to the ultimate test. 
### Questions
* Would it be beneficial to petition for schools to include for technological databases of history in their syllabus'?
* Were Waller's works done entirely online or were they done physically and then converted to online files?
* What is the line between appreciating what technology has done for history, and becoming overwhelmed of this technology? Who decides the line?
