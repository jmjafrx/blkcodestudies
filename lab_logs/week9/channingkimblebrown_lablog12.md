## Lab Log #12 | Channing Kimble-Brown

### Overview

**"Database as a Genre of New Media"**

* Lev Manovich writes about how the organization of databases has kind of taken over our way of thinking about life, ursurping the more literary and cinematic narrative approach. He describes databases as collections of data structures that are not put together in any significant order and can be accessed in several different ways to mean several different things, if anything at all. He contrasts this idea of database logic with the idea of linear narratives that have a purpose and a meaning, which he even links to algorithms which always partern with data structures to make computers function. He argues that we've been moving in this direction already since things like CD-ROMs were already database-like and since we now have the internet, everything seems to overlay some kind of database logic. Because if databases' prominence, narrative doesn't seem to hold as much value anymore.

**"A New Assessment of the Transatlantic Slave Trade"**

* This document is the first chapter of a book containing essays analyzing newfound data about the transatlantic slave trade. In recent years, along with the rise in actual interest and concern for human rights that never existed on this scale before, researchers have been able to determine a significant larger amount of information concerning slave ships and as a result have had to create a database to store the data, provide statistics and allow scholars to pay attention to previously neglected branches of the slave trade. All of this new data was extracted from multiple sources of data on the same voyages. The researchers usually have to infer where the ship was going and how many slaves were onboard. A big task is determining whether slave ships made it to their destinations at all. The rest of the chapter discusses some information that was extrapolated and lays out the rest of the book.

**The H-Net Gor√©e Debate**

* Several historians debate in an email thread how the lies told by African entrepeneurs like Joseph D'Niaye about the House of Slaves in Goree being a major slave trade stop should be challenged in the interest of maintaining facts or tolerated in the interest of sensitivity to the emotional significance the place has to African Americans. Some historians worried that the emotional weight was being ignored and one person felt challenging the significance of Goree was akin to Holocaust denial while others felt that allowing such lies to go out into the world unchecked and uncorrected goes against the very nature of the profession that is being a historian. They seemed to come to a consensus that both issues are important and that the value of a sort of social landmark shouldn't be determined by pure quanititative facts, but the quantitative facts must be held to high standards as well.

**From Here I Saw What Happened, And Cried**

* Carrie Mae Weems created a beautiful photo collection that consists of several red-tinted photos of African Americans bookended by what I believe is a black and white photo of an African woman facing the red photos. Each image has a caption that, when read in order, tells a story of an African woman watching all the horrible things that white people did to black people and how those struggles made her cry.

### Reflection

These works all seem to tap into the idea that databases are kind of taking over in different ways. The new assessment of transatlantic slave trade makes me agree with the sentiment that databases are favored for getting meaning from large amounts of data, but it is all in interest of creating a bunch of small narratives to piece together one overarching narrative about what the transatlantic slave trade was like and how many it affected. The Goree debate was interesting because it kind of fell into a debate between narrative and database but ultimately concluded that both were equally important to understanding history and giving proper weight to events of the past. Even the art that Weems created has both an online version and an physical version that you can go to see in poerson, giving people multiple ways to interact with the same content but unlike regular databases that don't really have an agenda or message, this work had a very clear narrative that is basically spelled out to the viewer if you read the captions and view their images in order.

### Expand

This [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/28/the-house-just-voted-to-wipe-out-the-fccs-landmark-internet-privacy-protections/?utm_term=.18fd45ae37e4) talks about how House Republicans recently voted to strip ISPs (Internet Service Providers) of any limitations that prevented them from selling information like "consumer browsing habits, app usage history, location data and Social Security numbers". Note that this is basically allowing ISPs like Verizon or Comcast to join the game, companies like Facebook and Google have been doing this forever. It seems relevant that more and more companies are being allowed to convert real life humans into data to be packaged and sold without consent. There's no order or narrative, people broken down into data structures.

### Comment

As an answer to Turquoisei's [third question](https://github.com/turquoisebaker/blkcodestudies/blob/d74982a93dd06ef3d232c5b7f557d772cb18b4ee/lab_logs/week9/turquoisebaker_LL12.md) it's hard for me to distinguish between which is more impactful at that level. Ultimately, anything that gives me a new perspective on events and stories that I did or did not know about is going to have the most impact. Of the things we have looked at so far, I'd say Space Traders definitely left the biggest impression because it managed to articulate the relationship that black people have with so many different groups in such a concise and frank manner. The magic the story is that the fantastical nature of the premise becomes way too real as it analyzes the role that black people play in the US and how both black and non-black people feel about black people. But I'm not sure if I'd categorize that as a new concept since it's an original fictional story when it relies so heavily on our familiarity with the history of the United States.

### Question

1. Why is it surprising that narratives still exist in new media? Do people not naturally look to translate everything into some sort of narrative to better understand what has happened and predict will will happen next? 
2. Is there any data on the number of African Americans that have visited these African slave site tourism scams? Perhaps it's just because no one I know alive in my family has ever left the continent period but I've never heard of anyone having any emotional ties to these small slave trade posts.
3. In Weem's photo collection, is there any significance to the repetition of "HA" throughout the captions?
