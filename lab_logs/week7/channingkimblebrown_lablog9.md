## Lab Log #9 | Channing Kimble-Brown

### Overview

**"Space Traders"**

* Derrick Bell tells a story about aliens landing in the United States and offering them a solution to all their energy, pollution and economic crises in exchange for all of their black citizens. Throughout the story we meet the president, his cabinet, a conservative black man named Golightly, and several groups around the country that are either for or agains the trade for several reasons. In the general sense, black people universally don't want to leave with these aliens that never say what will happen to black people that are taken (other than that they aren't being taken to be prisoners). White people generally want to take the deal, seeing it as a sacrifice that they are willing to make. In the days leading up to the deadline for the decision, we see the president, his cabinet members, televangelists, and lower and middle class white people doing everything they can to justify and facilitate removing all the black Americans. Black people across the board, Jewish people, the white corporate elite, and some white allies try to fight sending black people away but they ultimately fail. Too many white people are able to convince themselves that the country only ever progresses when black people are sacrificed and they see this as enough reason to ratify an amendment that allows the government to make the exchange and all the black people are taken away to a place unknown.

**"Ellen Craftâ€™s Radical Techniques of Subversion"**

* Uri McMillan writes about the escape of William and Ellen Craft from slavery and the use of performance. He starts off talking about props they needed, like passes and a disguise to hide Ellen's femininity since she already looked white. They ended up using a poultrice to hide her face and a sling to hide the fact that she can't write. McMillan describes Ellen as not only acting like a white man but becoming a white man through performance and the sling sort of performing the act of writing, replacing the action and classifying her as a white man. He also says that her ability to perform whiteness and gain validation from an audience in and of itself turns whiteness into a performance. He connects this back to drag balls held in the 90s by black and latino gay men and trans people. They often would act the part of cis straight men and their proximity to "realness" allowed them to move about the world with much more freedom than their natural selves would have been able to. The last thing he discusses is the Crafts time abroad, lecturing in England as abolitionists, telling white English people of their story and condeming the United States for slavery. Women weren't allowed to speak at such events in England at the time so Ellen sat and observed, serving as a visual center piece to confirm that truth of William's tale. At one event the people call for her presence and she curtsies before them, appropriating a movement typically indicating white middle class femininity. McMillan describes Ellen as being fluid in trans-racial bodily vocabulary, since black women are usually held in direct contrast to refinement, fragility, gentelness, all qualities associated with white women alone.


**"'Raving Amazons': Antiblackness and Misogynoir in Social Media" (Revisited)**

* _[From lab log 7]_ l'Nasah Crockett wrote specifically about black women on Twitter and how other twitter users have interacted with them. She says that Twitter has been great for building networks of black women but at the same time it has brought surveillance of black people to a whole new frontier. People from the left and the right (like 4chan) have been stalking and harassing black women online since the platform has been built. The right likes to infiltrate and try to convince outsiders that black women are causing problems and the left likes to observe black women's behavior and often get mad at black women for being upset when leftist groups are antiblack. This behavior from all over the political specturm trace back to the days of slave patrols and when all non-black people were deputized to watch and control black people. They can only justify treating black women this way by believing that black women don't feel any pain so the best way to survive is self-defense, because no one else is coming to help.

### Reflection

The Space Traders story was really unsettling to say the least. And I think the think that most disturbed me was how plausible it was, and how accurately it dragged so many groups in this country, white and black alike. I also really appreciated that the story maintained so much tension even though we knew that black people were probably going to be sent away. As we watched the events unfold, I felt like one of the black people uninvolved in the decision-making or rallying, just resigned to the fact that white America would do everything in its power to get rid of black people. It also was a great way to showcase how so many non-black groups of people use or depend on blackness, pretty much always at the expense of black people. In thinking about everything Bell was trying to say, I feel like the intro paragraph at the beginning of the book that talks about looking into the bottom of the well perfectly sums up the story. I just wish we knew what happened. The story about the Crafts was much more uplifting. It was almost opposite _Space Traders_ in many ways. It's a real story, black people are using whiteness to their own benefit, actively and cleverly using whiteness against white people as Golightly urged the black leadership to do in _Space Traders_. And it also tells the story of successful escape, while many of the black people in _Space Traders_ didn't make it out of the country. The end of the Craft ties directly to a lot of what's going on in the Raving Amazons article. Black femininity is demonized and black women are seen as slaves, meant for hard labor and primitivity and that kind of thinking seems to be very much related to the way of thinking of people on the internet that don't seem to think that black women don't need or deserve to be protected or sheltered. Or if they do, they don't seem to care.

### Expand

_Note: I wrote this before seeing Zoya's lab log and I hope adding the second tweet makes this different enough._

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny.

This tweet comes from a Republican Representative from Iowa that is supporting an islamaphobic tweet about the Netherlands. This took place March 12, 2017. This kind of othering of religious (and if we're being totally honest ethnic) groups is extremely similar to how white people viewed black people in _Space Traders_. He clearly believes that people certain groups are in the way of progress to the benefit of "his people".

Within 48 hours, he also made the following tweet, disturbingly echoing Trump's campaign slogan and showing no remorse or concern for the white nationalism that he had exhibited hours earlier:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ll be up on <a href="https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson">@TuckerCarlson</a> this hour.

### Comment

Regarding  Zoya's [third question](https://github.com/ZSattar/blkcodestudies/blob/51c6078087a3f92495014a38adfeabaf585044fc/lab_logs/week6/Zoya%20Sattar%20LL9.md), I think it definitely would be considered pure performance. She shares nothing in common with the character she is playing and everything that she did, the privilege that she accessed from pretending to be a white slaveholding man, was an false and temporary. Gone as soon as she lost her audience, whether it be from white people finding out or from them reaching their destination and Ellen not needing the character anymore.

### Question
0. McMillan talks about performing whiteness delegitimizes it as an actual identity and makes it seem like more of a performance. Is the same thing going on with blackness when white people practice blackface? (Feel free to also mention Rachel Dolezal or whatever her name is now...)
0. Bell's story criticizes the black elite, whether they be black leaders fighting racism or black conservatives seemingly throwing black people under the bus to get ahead. Where exactly would effective leadership fall? Is class and education somehow hindering black people from effectively fighting for black liberation no matter which way you lean?
0. If the aliens said that they were taking black people to a kind of paradise, would you believe them? Do you think that the nation's response would have changed at all?
