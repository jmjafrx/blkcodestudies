# Summary

* **Parham, Marisa. “Saying‘ Yes’: Textual Traumas in Octavia Butler’s Kindred.” Callaloo 32, no. 4 (2009): 1315–1331.** 

Marisa Parham begins the text with an overview of how common it is for people to only symtaphize or rationalize the position of the oppressor in historical contexts. Further proving her point with an example of how difficult it can be to disucss the erasure of history, her set up leads smoothly into describing the science fiction book by Octavia Butler named *Kindred*. Parham describes not only the plot of the novel, but also analyzes what one can get out of it after reading. A black woman, who is married to a white man, experiences time travel spells where she must save her white grandfather. The only way she can return is if she feels she's going to die. Parham explores the problems of history being viewed as ended, unrelated events to the future, interracial relationships, and emotional and physical violence.

* **Derrick Bell, "Space Traders" Faces at the Bottom of the Well**

In this short story by Derrick Bell, the United States is faced with a situation: extraterrestrial beings come to the U.S. and offer solutions to all of the enovironmental and fiscal problems within the country for all the black/African American people in return. The short story goes through the various situations from the day the proposal is made to the day after the decision is made. In this journal-like text, the reader explores the opposing groups' arguments and theories and how the United States in general handles the situation. 

* **McMillan, Uri. “Ellen Craft’s Radical Techniques of Subversion.” E-Mésferica 5, no. 2 (2008).** 

Throughout this article, Uri McMillan discusses the performance theory that pervaded ex-slaves Ellen and William Craft's escape, the lives of the queer colored people in the movie *Paris Is Burning*, and Ellen claiming black femininity after her escape. McMillan begins with a description of the preparations taken by Ellen and William to use Ellen's extremely light complexion to reach freedom. These included saving clothing items and using Ellen's higher status as a "well-liked" slave to leave. McMillian then draws comparisons from the gay men in *Paris Is Burning* participating in drag shows and places them next to Ellen's performance as a white man who was travelling with a slave. After this, McMillan mentions this performance aspect yet agian with Ellen curtsying after a talk in Scotland with her husband and a friend of theirs about their plight. 


# Reflection

Thinking of history as something that never really ends is a really big concept to wrap my head around but it's something I intend on doing. This, paired with Parham's article also going over the importance of recognizing the inability to understand some people's individual histories complicates the concept but also makes sense of the idea. I can't help but relate this to the African American History Museum and the bottom section of the building. The way this massive collection is set up almost completely eliminates the present. What I mean is that the glass elevator that takes you to the beginning of their archives is surrounded by black walls on all four sides, however except on one of these walls are numbers of years, furthermore, you are literally travelling back in time. Personally, it was a moving experience, I nearly started crying because I felt scared of what I would've been forced to encounter as a black woman had I have really been going back in time, and I actually forgot for a split second that I was in 2017 in a building. This easily malleable idea of time and history is toyed with in *Kindred* as Parham describes, but actually experiencing the mild version of it is frightening to say the least.

This [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD-SZGpYr7o) by The Social Experiment was the only thing I could think of when the concept of rememory/re-membering was brought up.


# Comment

In Turquoise's lab log for this assignment she asks if the art of "subversive transgressions" has died because of the fact that anyone can assume any identity. First, I think to say that any concept is "dead" is a really big claim with so many people living so many lives that are all different and simultaneously linked to everyone else in some way. With that in mind, I feel that this question isn't based off of correct information, specifically the phrase/assumption that anyone can assume any identity. In their article, McMillan focuses strongly on the fact that Ellen Craft was not only performing her act, but living it. Ellen did not just put on some clothes, a cast, and something around her face, she demanded respect from a white man, and she became Mr. William Johnson. The phrasing of the question puts me off because if we put this in the context of transgender people, and for the sake of this class transgender black people, then we're also assuming that the identities that they are trying to get other people to believe in aren't their identities. This wording makes me feel as if black trans* women and men aren't actually living out their identities when choosing to dress the way they wish or participate in particular activities, an idea that I just don't find to be true. 

# Questions

* Black people can verify rather quickly that they "perform" at almost all times of the day, especially when in places that aren't majority-black. In what ways have you altered your actions, or in what ways have you seenyour black peers change their actions?

* Variations of the phrase "the needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few" has floated around philosphy, ethics, and now this class. What would be the arguments against this idea (because we all know it wouldn't happen), if the aliens asked for every white person who was considered to live under the poverty line? What kind of people would we see lead the charge of this opposition?

* In Space Traders, Professor Gleason Golightly (his name *having* to be a reference to the [really famous poem by Dylan Thomas](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night) ) is seen as an Uncle Tom to all black people, and the only logical black person on Earth to the white people, but his true intentions and feelings are never discovered by either group. With black people like him existing both in a bright spotlight and quietly in the suburbs, do you think it's better to "walk the line" between the two races quietly or loudly proclaim your support for black people? Which do you think would yield more success?
