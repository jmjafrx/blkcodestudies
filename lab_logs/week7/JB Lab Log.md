**Overview**

*Space Traders*

The adaptation of Derrick Bell’s short story “The Space Traders” was a great visual component to an already fantastic science fiction drama. The short film did not exactly stay true to Bell’s piece. The director, producer, and writer took some creative license in their dramatization. For example, Bell does not assign Plymouth Rock as the site where the Traders are greeted by the American delegation. Bell writes that Americans lined the Atlantic Coast from Cape Cod to North Carolina. Reggie Hudlin includes Plymouth Rock as a symbolic reminder of one of America’s founding sites and the location for America’s future success. The film also gives Professor Golightly a more prominent role and introduces his family including his daughter and son and his son’s girlfriend. Golightly does not testify in front of Congress, but instead secretly attends Black community gatherings. Also, Golightly’s entire family is taken to the departure site in the story. In the film, Golightly and his children are forced to leave the US, but his wife, a woman of fairer skin remains in the United States. Despite these changes, the film does not deviate much for Bell’s story. White Americans appear less reluctant to keep Black Americans. There was less resistance in the film. 

*The Brother from Another Planet*

In John Styles’ film, the main character “The Brother” is an alien visitor who appears as a Black man. “The Brother” lands in a vacant lot in across from Manhattan Island, but relocates to Harlem. He is dressed in tattered clothing, is mute, and is missing his right foot. The Brother resembles and perhaps is an escaped slave from the planet he is from. He possesses several powers such as telekinesis and the ability to heal wounds. Throughout the film, the Brother hears drumming, which is later revealed to be a command call to other escapees from his planet on Earth. The Brother is avoiding recapture by white men who dress in all back. They resemble slave catchers and invade spaces that the Brother uses for shelter and safety in pursuit of him. These Men in Black possess superhuman abilities making them nearly untouchable to humans. The Brother engages in human actions such as sex and drug abuse. The Men in Black catch up to the Brother and have him in custody. However, the Brother, now familiar with New York’s terrain outsmarts the Men in Black, lures them into a trap, which results in their self-immolation.

*Pumzi*

This short film takes on post-apocalyptical society where water has become scarce. Asha, a scientist, lives in a subterranean community in Nairobi where she has vivid dreams of eco life outside of her constrained society. The outside world is completely barren, resembling a desert. Asha rations all liquid, including her sweat and urine. These bodily fluids are then purified into drinking water, not a bad idea. Asha has some authority. We do not see her working to sustain the facility, but enjoying a degree of freedom. Asha finds a plant that she believes holds the key to life outside of the bunker. She sits in the Virtual Museum of Natural History, but is told to not pursue her research by the administrative council. She is reprimanded, but escapes to the desert and sees a mirage of the tree in her dreams. She plants the tree and then the camera pans out to a mountain range with a shrub. 

**Reflection**

I am not the biggest science fiction fan, but I found an appreciation for sci-fi stories written by Black writers. I find that the films for this week are more realistic than some of the canonical stories and films of sci fi such as Star Trek and Mad Max. In Pumzi, for example, water scarcity forces society into controlled environments where water is rationed. This reality is one that is a fear in our society and a growing problem for regions outside of the Western world. Some political pundits argue that water wars are the next international crisis that humanity will tackle. 

I noticed that in The Brother from Another Planet only the Men in Black spoke English. The Brother and the other escapees communicated via music. I wonder if “The Brother” was muted as a condition of his enslavement. He can understand English, but does not have the communicate ability to respond to questions verbally. 

**Comment** 

In response to Megan’s first question, Golightly made his celebrity critiquing Black political activism in support of white supremacist policies. He trained himself and his family to assimilate into white culture and viewed this as a necessity to end racial strife. Golightly only realized the racism behind conservative agenda when it would affect him. I think his past transgressions made Golightly’s appeal impossible to be heard.

**Questions**

1. Why do you think “The Brother” is mute, but can understand English? What might this tell of “The Brother’s” origins? 
2. Did you find the film adaptation of “The Space Traders” more emotionally taxing or more underwhelming than the short story? 
3. What was the central message of Pumzi? What are viewers supposed to gain from watching the film?
