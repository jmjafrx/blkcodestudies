## Overview
### Brother From Another Planet
  This film focuses on a slave from outer space who escapes to Earth, while bounty hunters try to find and recapture him. This "Brother" is an alien who resembles a Black man with strange feet, which is the only thing that distishes him from Black men on Earth. He lands on Ellis island and is received as an immigrant in Harlem and quickly makes friends with a bar owner and regular customers. He makes money by being able to fix machines and heal people with his hands, and has psychic abilities which allow him to feel the experiences of previous immigrants who arrived in Harlem. He also cannot speak which ends up being to his advantage, and is able to point to a slave in a museum and demonstrate to the boy that he too is a slave.  
### Saying‘ Yes’: Textual Traumas in Octavia Butler’s Kindred
  Parham discusses the science fiction book "Kindred" by Octavia Butler to emphasize the idea that people often erase history and how it affects and pertains to modern issues and the tracing of patterns throughout history. She begins by explaining that people are usually quick to sympathize and give excuses for wrongdoings and the people who committed them. People rationalize why opressors do the things they do, instead of completely condeming their actions, which leads to the erasure of history. This leads into the discussion of Kindred where a black woman, who is married to a white man, is caught in time travel to save her white grandfather. She explains the violence that the woman has to go through and how trapped she is unless she may actually die. 
## Reflection
  Parham's discussion of viewing history as just a thing of the past, rather than something that influences and deeply affects current situations, ties into Black Code studies because the erasure of the history of the treatment of African Americans in this country is highly damaging to the way Blackness is viewed in modern society. The movie reminded me of the way that Black voices are often silenced and written off as hysteric (especially Black women) because many characters in the movie didn't even notice that the Brother was mute because they just wanted to talk and talk.

## Comment
  In response to Jack, I don't think that our response would mirror the response shown in Space Traders. I don't think that enough people in this country would be willing to send away all African Americans in exchange for anything because there are enough good people who would never allow for that to happen. While the administration in power right now is racist and fascist, the majority of this country is more intrinsically (which is still very harmful.. don't get me wrong) racist and wouldn't be so willing to do something that blatantlyhorrific.
## Questions
  * Do you think that white people purposely like to forget about the past, or do they actually think that it doesn't affect the current state of the nation?
  * How can we encourage edcuation for the masses to understand the link between slavery and the racist structures that exist today?
  * Why is the Brother in the film mute? What purpose do you think this trait serves?
