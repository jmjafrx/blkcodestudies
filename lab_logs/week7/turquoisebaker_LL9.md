#### Overview

Derrick Bell, "Space Traders" Faces at the Bottom of the Well

- In Derrick Bell’s “Space Traders”, an alien race peacefully descends from space, promising gold to bail out the United States, chemicals to “unpollute” the environment, and a safe alternative to oil and coal. The cost: “to take back to their home star all the African Americans who lived in the United States” (Bell 160). Gleason Golightly, a conservative and only Black person relatively close to the President, made a case to the President and his cabinet members against selling African Americans and sending them to space, which was ignored. His appeal to the liberal parties, in which he suggests using the white man’s psychology to their benefit, was seen as a betrayal to the being of Black people. The only concession made was that African Americans 70 and older, ill, disabled, or injured could remain. On January 17, Martin Luther King day, the African Americans “left the New World as their forebears had arrived”, in chains (Bell 194).

- This article tells the story of William and Ellen Craft: married African-American slaves from Georgia who in December 1848, formulated a plan to escape. The pair thought of everything. Ellen, with lighter skin, would pretend to be a man travelling with her “slave” (William). Her right arm was wrapped as if injured, making her “unable to write”, and her chin and part of her face was covered to hide her lack of facial hair and feminine features. She embodied the mannerisms the fictional character, Mr. William Johnson, consequently creating a “subversive transgression of taut 19th century racial, class and gender categories” (McMillan). McMillan notes that Ellen’s feat was one of “being” and “realness” as used in Jennie Livingston’s 1991 film _Paris is Burning_. Throughout the article, the author explores Ellen’s “prosthetic performance” (her sling), and literacy as a synonym to whiteness, her “curtsey” and black and white femininity.

#### Reflection

- Derrick Bell’s “Space Traders” was disheartening, yet incredible. What I found especially interesting was the “entry” under “5 January”, in which major business leaders of corporate America formulated a mass media plan to discourage others from supporting the Space Traders’ proposal. However, they did not do so because it was “right”, but because the instantaneous disappearance of 12% of their market would be terrible inconvenience. If these are the types of people Golightly is trying to dissuade from selling the African American people, perhaps he is right to try and use cunning against them. However, even in the face “America’s version of the Final Solution”, many shared the same sentiments of Reverend Jasper: “I do not choose to save myself by a tactic that may preserve my body at the sacrifice of my soul” (Bell 186, 177). Is trying “to get whites to do right by black people because it was right” truly “crazy” (Bell 171)? The questions this work provokes are controversial to say the least. But, that should not prevent us from discussing, and honestly analyzing their implications.

- Here is a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/us/derrick-bell-pioneering-harvard-law-professor-dies-at-80.html) on Derrick Bell, Harvard Law School’s first tenured Black professor, Civil Rights activist, and a man infamous for his “provocative career moves”, including his “voluntary unpaid leave of absence to protest the lack of tenured minority female professors” (Bernstein). He died on October 5, 2011 at 80 years of age.
 
#### Comment

- In response to JB’s third question from Lab Log 8, I would say we are in an age in which archiving occurs simultaneously as history. Sites like Tumblr and even the screenshot capabilities of our phones allow us to create personal archives. However, I believe this is a double edged sword. Databases and archives before the invention of these platforms and smartphones, were special, in part, because the original had value (ex. documents like the Constitution or the Federalist papers). Now, our news (ex. Donald Trump’s tweets), and with every preceding second, our history, has no “source” or “original copy”. Because of this, I think it is easy to overlook the significance of what is constantly being buried on our ever growing databases. I definitely realize that there are hundreds of other factors, some even unrelated, that affect our tendencies to take news seriously. I’m not saying I hate social media or anything, or that it’s all bad, but it is something to think about. 

#### Questions

- McMillan praises Ellen Craft’s ability to physically embody something she is not. In Crockett’s article, we see examples of white women posing as Black women on social media platforms. With the capability of social media in mind, would you conclude that the art of “subversive transgressions” has died, if anyone can assume an identity? 

- (Inspired by “Space Traders”) Is it worth sacrificing one’s own “soul” to save oneself? Is saving oneself (or even another) not worth it if we are untrue to ourselves?

- With so many people able to archive and use what is found on social media, is there a way to change the culture or the platforms themselves to allow for proper recognition and ownership of one’s creations, like #BlackLivesMatter? Would this infringe on the “beauty of social media”?
