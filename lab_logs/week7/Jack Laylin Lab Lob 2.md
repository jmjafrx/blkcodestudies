# Overview: 

### Space Traders

This surrealist adaptation of the source material visualizes and emphasizes the most bizarre points of the written version. The entire film walks a fine line between comedy and discomfort. For example, the cabinet scene has US leaders openly admitting that they would relish the opportunity to expel black citizens. The “Oreo” protagonist attempts to strike a deal for his family’s safe passage. That ultimately fails too. In the end, the black people are sucked up into the UFOs. It’s almost completely without pomp or circumstance, underlining how easy the decision was for white America.

### Brother from Another Planet

Equally as bizarre as Space Traders, Brother From Another Planet is some sort of afro-futurist sci-fi surrealist ahistorical allegory of slavery. A “brother” literally from another planet crash lands in Harlem and stumbles his way through a couple days, meeting new people, fixing pinball machines, and testing out heroin along the way. He’s eventually taken in by a family and bonds with a small child who doesn’t mind that the Brother is mute. Later, he is captured by two men in strange monochromatic black outfits (Men in Black?) to be returned to slavery on his home planet.

### Pumzi (dir. Wanuri Kahiu)

The film takes place in a futuristic dystopian Kenya after World War III, aka “The Water War.” The protagonist takes a dream suppressant pill, goes to generate energy for her community on a treadmill and purify her urine into drinking water. She discovers some soil that allows her plant to grow but her superiors forbid her from studying it further. She escapes her community in search of the place where the soil came from, and finds nothing. She plants the small tree in the sand and gives it the rest of her water. As the end credits role, we see that she was just on the other side of the mountains dividing the desert she knows from the lush and unknown rainforest.

### Black Moses Barbie Commercials

This is a satirical imagination of black barbies telling the story of Harriet Tubman. The “⅗ of somebody joke” and the Cat Lady abolitionist jokes are my favorite. These are incredibly clever and campy. I don’t think a comedic retelling of the Underground Railroad would work in any other context. They filmmaker is retelling the traumatic story of runaway slaves in the context of American popular culture.

### Parham, Marisa. “Saying‘ Yes’: Textual Traumas in Octavia Butler’s Kindred.

Parham talks about Butler and her protagonist’s efforts to identify with the struggles of her ancestors. She describes a “strategy for passing on painful histories.” The character, after witnessing the brutal oppression of slaves first-hand through time travel, still feels disconnected from her heritage. History, she says, is impossible to experience from one’s own consciousness. Moreover, studying history is to take on a decidedly biased worldview determined by winners in service of the national political majority. The author claims that Dana’s time traveling is actually a form of introspection. She’s seeing her heritage literally play our in the form of a historical dream viewed within the genetic material she inherited from enslaved Africans.

# Reflect:

Parham’s piece was a bit difficult to place, because I haven’t read the books she is talking about. However, I empathize with her characters who struggle to relate to their ancestors and find themselves questioning history. I though Space Traders was absolutely fantastic, much like the source material but with equally absurd visuals. It had all the right 90s visual markers, which makes it even better in my book. Brother from Another Planet did not need to be almost two hours long. I think it could have easily fit into a short film, much the way Space Traders did. But, the concept and dialogue was extremely well done. There seemed to be a parallel commentary on how self-absorbed people are, because they all carry on talking at the Brother despite his non-response. Pumzi was my favorite of all the pieces. Although the film’s camp was less endearing than the Barbie and Space Trader pieces, it remained a thoughtful (but not too deep) imagining of a water-less world in a dystopian future completely occupied by black characters. The director co-opted the sci-fi genre, which has always been mostly white and asian, for the black cast and audience quite successfully. The end credit text-spin was the best part!

# Expand:

Pumzi constantly reminded me of the opening bars of New Slaves by Kanye West:

My momma was raised in the era when / Clean water was only served to the fairer skin

# Comment:

Megan asked if the Brother’s silence is a metaphor for slaves not consenting to slavery. I think it could be that, but I want to propose a second idea: that the Brother is silent because he is literally an Alien, much like the Africans were in America. They were dropped in this foreign country and expected to understand orders, or even the basics concept of the english language, with almost no tutelage.

# Question:
1. What responsibility do places like Colonial Williamsburg have to exhibit their slave history faithfully? Would it even exist if they did so?
2. Where is the black-dominated film industry thriving? Is there a “Hollywood” of Africa?
3. If Mattel actually made a Harriet Tubman barbie, would we be up in arms or thankful?
