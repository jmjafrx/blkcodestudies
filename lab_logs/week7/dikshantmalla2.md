#Overview 
* Space Traders
One significant change in the movie from the story is that Professor Golightly has a more developed role. In the movie we are introduced his family, and provided a more structured story about his life. I like this choice because it allows the audience to look at his situation from a specific perspective instead of simply looking at the story as a whole. 

* The Brother from Another Planet
In the film "The Brother" comes to earth from another planet and lands in New York. The film follows his time in Harlem and throughout New York. Initially, he is confused and lost but as time progresses he tries various human activities like sex and drugs. As the movie develops, he is chased by two men in black who are also aliens trying to take the Brother and other alines back to their home planet.

* Pumzi
This film is set in a post-apocalyptical society where there is minimal access to water. The main character Asha dreams of a society where there is water and ecological development. In order to preserve liquid she conserves her urine and sweat and uses a mechanism to help turn it into drinkable water. Asha receives a seed and sees it as a sign of developing nature. However scientists refuse to let her study the seed, so she runs away and in the desert she plants the seed in a soil and uses her last water supply to help it grow.

# Reflection
After watching the Black Moses Barbie series, one thing I thought about was the production of a narrative. While they were short, I really enjoyed this series because it does a good job of producing a narrative where Harriet Tubman is the main character and her actions are shown. I think historical documentaries and films about Tubman often do not feature her as the point of conversation instead they focus on slavery and it conditions as the foreground and Tubman and her work go into the background. I think this series does a good job of promoting Tubman to the foreground by showing her actions, instead of simply re-telling them. I think this is powerful because instead of viewing Tubman as an isolated historical figure, this series treats her like an individual and a hero as the same time.

The dystopian nature of Pumzi made me think about Mad Max and its theme of inequality and redemption. I hope in the future there can be a movie that intersects these two themes of inequality, greed, redemption and resistance by focusing on both race and class. 

# Comment
To answer Megan's second question, I do not think Africans were allowed to bring anything during the Middle Passage. I think the fact that African Americans were able to bring a carry on is indicative of how this is a modern day form of slavery and the evolution of technology. 

# Questions
1. Why do you think the director of Space Traders decided to make Professor Golightly a primary character in the movie?
2. What is the significance of the seed in Pumzi? Is it symbolic of life and the future or a way of showing what resistance against authority and society can look like?
3. I noticed that in the first part of the Black Moses Barbie, the two runaway barbies are smiling, is this intentional or is is just how the barbies look?
