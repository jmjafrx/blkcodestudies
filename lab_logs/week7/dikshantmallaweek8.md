* "Mapping a Slave Revolt" Visualizing Spatial History through the Archives of Slavery by Vincent Brown

In the article Brown discusses the changing nature of history. Borrowing anthropologist Michel-Rolph Trouillot, he argues that "historical knowledge is produced over time as an artifact of power" and that silence in historical knowledge signifies the importance of that power. Brown also argues that with the advancement of technology it is important to integrate historical knowledge with technology. For instance, digital visualization offers us a new perspective on history that text and archival material cannot provide. He uses his project "Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760-1761: A Cartographic Narrative" to visually show the spatial history of the revolt. Through the cartographic visualization, Brown is able to successfully show the viewers the nuanced geopolitical strategy of both the slaves and the slave masters. 


* Kara Walker harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) by Shannon Egan 
This article focuses on the the works of Kara Walker and challenges the critique of Walker's work as perpetuating racist stereotypes and creating racial jokes. Egan argues that instead of viewing Walker's work as jokes, the audience must understand the complexity within her work. Egan believes that Walker's work is influenced by physiognomy, the belief that links personality and physical form. By creating silhouettes that link black bodies to savagery, Walker is " persistently infiltrates narratives of American history with confrontational and disarming depictions of race, sex and gender".   

# Reflection
* I really enjoyed Brown's piece and found myself thinking about the Civil Rights movement and how history and historical interpretations are manipulations of power structures. When the Civil Rights Act passed in 1965, the dominant historical interpretation viewed it as a success, it was believed to be the end of racial tensions and inequality in America. Yet fifty-years later that perspective has dramatically changed. Many criticize the Act as a turning point in the Civi Rights movement and that the movement was more radically oriented then the actual act. I wanted to link Brown's theory to Civil Rights because I think it shows how even within "positive" historical moments that are seen as great moments in American history are manipulated and used to create a narrative to uphold that power structure.


# Expand
* Looking at Kara Walkers' piece made me think about a prominent Baltimore artist, Paul Rucker. Rucker' work is primarily related to African American history and in 2015 he received a lot of criticism for a piece where he created Klan clothing. Similar to Walker, Rucker wants to present history as a way to comment on the way history of inequality and brutality speaks about the current conditions in society. 


# Comment
* To answer Monica's question about white people, I don't think white people purposely forget the past but I think it is easier for them not to think about the past because it does not affect them. I think that is part of white privilege that people often forget to acknowledge. 
  
# Questions
1. Thinking about integrating technology with history, what role can science play in telling that history?
2. How can artists present their work as a commentary on history and society instead of simply acting as visual spectacles? 
3. Can you think of an instance/event where historical narrative is shaped by the sociopolitical content and the role power structures play within constructing that narrative?
