Overview
--------

**Space Traders**
This sci-fi drama short spans seventeen days on Earth following a proposition from an alien ambassador to provide ridiculous wealth, unlimited energy, and technological advances in exchange for all of the black people in America. The movie follows Gleason Golightly, a conservative black US cabinet member as he attempts to argue on both sides through cunning and deceit.

**Brother From Another Planet**
John Sayles’ film follows a mute alien with the appearance of a “brother” who appears in Harlem with his slave owners in close pursuit. Despite his muteness, the highly empathetic Brother befriends various members of the Harlem community, serving as a sounding board for the unheard and marginalized, while also discovering the beauty of black culture.

**Pumzi**
This film is set in a dystopian South Africa where water is extremely scarce following World War III. A young scientist escapes from an oligarchical zero-waste facility in search of the remaining habitable land. As the scientist sacrifices herself to protect her prized plant from the harsh desert, the camera pans to reveal a nearby rainforest on the other side of a mountain range.

**Parham - Saying “Yes”: Textual Traumas in Octavia Butler’s Kindred**
Parham shares the difficulties of reconciling the mindset of racial ideologies in foregone eras with modern sensibilities and notions of race. She examines science fiction pieces as a method of immersing oneself in the difficult nuances of context.

Reflect
-------

Reflecting on Parham’s piece, I’ve witnessed the generational differences in racial justification firsthand within my own family. My grandparents in their youth were conditioned to expect less than their white counterparts and internalized it. Although they could see the inequality in not receiving transportation to school, they believed that white features merited the treatment they received. My grandmother knew this personally, as her blue eyes earned her more favor from teachers, employers, etc. than her friends. Two generations later, this internal justification may seem ludicrous but it is truly difficult to say that I would have been on the fringes of society fighting against, rather than passing through along with the cultural norms.

Expand
------

It seemed to me as though Brother From Another Planet (1984) might have inspired two of my favorite childhood movies, Big (1988) and Encino Man (1992), albeit with an appropriately darker take on displacement and belonging. In particular, the museum scene resonated pretty succinctly.

Comment
-------

To JB’s question, I can’t tell why the Brother can’t speak English but I found two points of interest in the alien speech throughout the movie:
1. What was the artistic direction/intention behind the use of steel drums as the Brother’s language? It might’ve played better on screen than jazz scales via trumpet or bebop, but doesn’t necessarily represent the black experience in Harlem.
2. The white aliens had found a way to speak English, but it was still stilted and unnatural (“A beer…on the rocks”), maybe even appropriative?
