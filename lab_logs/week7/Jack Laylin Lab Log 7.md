# Overview: 

### Derrick Bell, "Space Traders”

This is a afrofuturist fiction piece is an alien race that promise unthinkably useful treasure in exchange for every single black American returning with them to their home star. In assembling his cabinet to propose sending all black Americans to space, the President includes a token black thinker who has upheld conservative and anti-civil rights policies. When asked for his opinion, the thinker, Dr. Golightly, is disgusted by the idea. The doctor then meets with the leading opposition of the proposal, he recommends black people give in and hope for a better world in the stars. Another delegation of major business executives sees major financial losses if 12% of the population is ejected from the planet and runs a massive campaign to reject the proposal. Americans voted 70-30 to ratify the amendment that allowed the trade to take place two days later.

### McMillan, Uri. “Ellen Craft’s Radical Techniques of Subversion.”

This is an analysis of a famous runaway slave story where a married couple pretends to be a slave and his owner and make their way north to freedom. The ruse is studied as a performance and “subversive transgression” of race, class, and gender norms. The author claims that Ellen Craft, the female slave, is especially able to impersonate the white upper class male and that this is an indication of the pliability of that identity. Ellen also claimed to be injured so as to obscure her feminine facial features and illiteracy. This, the author terms “prosthetic performance.” Because literacy in this context is the ultimate demarcation of whiteness, she is being especially subversive and daring in her costume.

### Crockett, I’Nasah. “‘Raving Amazons’: Antiblackness and Misogynoir in Social Media.”

What continues to surprise me whenever the 4Chan anecdote comes up is how a small group of bigots armed with 140-character tweets powerfully undermined the legitimacy of politically active black women. In addition, the article drives home a point about blackness and surveillance, which is normalized and fetishized as a means of control. It’s a disarming analysis of all white feminists and those who echo their sentiments.

# Reflect:

During the Fortune-500 business meeting in Bell’s Space Traders piece, I was hit with the realization that these leaders could commit themselves to the same solutions that the space traders offered and achieve a more beneficial outcome for themselves. Their expensive ad campaign to vote against the proposal could have fully funded a public school system, for example. It’s a funny irony that seems omnipresent in this futurist slavery allegory. The second article, although interesting, seems to make much ado about rather simple things. For example, the sling that hints at an injured-but-literate white male hand, simply obscures and healthy illiterate black female hand. Somehow the author ekes 8 paragraphs out of a simple case of contrast and subversive behavior. This is not to say that the Craft’s achievement is anything other than spectacular. It just fails to see that taking on a simplistic character for the sake of freedom is not a performance, but a necessity.

# Expand:

Space Traders reminds me of a film I watched last night, Arrival. (SPOILER ALERT) In that movie, aliens arrive with a gift that allows them to transcend time in the hopes that humans will rescue the aliens in about 300 years. It is obviously and crucially lacking any racial conversation, because the movie is strictly about language. But it’s an interesting question to ask under any circumstances: what would we do if aliens visited and asked to trade for something very valuable to us. I don’t think our response would be nearly as orderly as seen in Space Traders.

# Comment:

I agree with Zoya’s sentiment that Bell’s piece needs to be more widely circulated. We’re in a societal moment where the future is highly contested in every manner. Of course, change is nothing new to humans, but the challenges we all with soon face will disproportionately affect black Americans. This paradigm seems to demand a pseudo-thought piece like Space Traders, regardless of the fact that it’s fiction.

# Question:
1. Is it still true that racially ambiguous (for example, black women that conform to white standards of beauty) peoples are in the vanguard of subverting racial stereotypes?
2. The presidency described in “Space Traders” is startlingly like our own. Would our response mirror this fiction?
3. How many other stories like the Craft’s exist?
