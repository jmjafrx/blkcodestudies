# Overview
* Anthony Chase Letter 
Anthony Chase letter is written to Jeremiah Hoffman, who was his owner at the time of his escape. In the letter Chase has a very apologetic tone and states that he had to run way in a hope for better life. He also writes that his original master had promised him freedom after his death but Chase was still enslaved. He also says that while many might speculate that he ran away because of his wife's influence, it was ultimately his decision to "do justice to himself" (2) and to provide a better life for his family. 

* "Runaways Selections from a WPA interviews of formerly enslaved African Americans, 1936-1938"
This piece provides a collection of lived experiences from former slaves. These stories range from how they were mistreated to stories about failed runway attempts. A story that really interested me was the one about the house slave who hit her mistress and ran away and lived in a cave for seven years and raised three kids without anyone every finding her. 

* "Left of Black with Jasmine Nichole Cobb"
In this interview with Professor Jasmine Nicole Cobb, she discusses her new book "Picture Freedom: Remaking Black Visuality in the Early Nineteenth Century". She starts the interview by stating that her initial intentions was to study the visual representations of free black people before the abolition of slavery however this changed when she realized that much of the visuals within the time period reduced free black people to caricatures. She expanded her research beyond images and looked at artistic works such as paintings to study free black people. One example she lists is the work of Monica Miller and how her work in fashion and self styling spoke about representations and emancipation.   


* "I Could Not Stay There: Enslaved Women, Truancy and the Geography of Everyday Forms of Resistance in the Antebellum Plantation South" by Stephanie M.H. Camp
In this article Camp discusses the practice of truancy and absenteeism performed during antebellum plantation south. Camp describes the practice of truancy as bonds people's attempt to temporarily escape from the harsh working and living conditions in the plantation. Truancy is distinct from escapes as it is not an attempt to permanently escape plantation life, instead an attempt to take a break from the violence of slavery. Camp argues that while many view this practice as benign, it was a direct challenge to the authority of the owner. She introduces the term "rival geography" and states that truancy allowed bonds people to escape the geographic confinement of plantation life established by the plantation owner, and map their own space that extended beyond the plantation and into the nearby surrounding area. Truancy is also an act of resistance as it directly challenges the labor of production and negatively affects the profits the plantation owner is able to produce. Camp ends the article by stating that bonds people who repeatedly engaged in truancy were crucial at the start of the Civil War due to their expert knowledge of the geographic area. 

* "Mathematics Black Life" by Katherine McKittrick
In the article McKittrick discusses anti-blackness, white supremacy and its implications on the production of knowledge. McKittrick starts her with an analysis of the Middle Passage stating that the history of slavery and colorism legitimized violence against black bodies. She is referring to violence both in the past and the present. She argues that slavery is the blueprint for modernity which means it is important to study slavery, specifically the violence it produced, as it is the foundation for modern day violence. She then relates this to knowledge production indicating that since the knowledge is produced within the framework of anti-blackness, that knowledge will always assume black subjects to be subpart human. 

# Reflection

* I thoroughly enjoyed Stephanie M.H. Camp's article on truancy because it discusses an integral method of resistance that we often do not talk about. I found the discussion about women and fugitivity to be quite interesting. In the article, Camp indicates that many bondwomen were unable and unwilling to run away from the plantation because of community norms. Women were often shunned if they attempted to leave their communities and more importantly their children because they had responsibility within plantation life. Taking this into consideration, it is no surprise that bondwomen were more likely to engage in truancy and absenteeism compared to men. After reading the article, one question that many readers might have is why would people run away for a limited time and voluntarily come back. I don't claim to be an expert and this is just opinion- many bondpeople engaged in truancy because they were unhappy with their circumstances and gained genuine satisfaction by running away. Even though they anticipate punishment upon retuning, the satisfaction of being away from the plantation, even for a brief moment, outweighs the consequences. I think this nicely relates to  the theme of "justice" in Anthony Chase's letter, and more importantly informs us that resistance is not just bondpeople running up north and gaining legal freedom, instead it is them taking matters into their own hands.

# Comment
* I am answering Jack's question from his log post from last week. The question reads "What do you make of the interracial creative team? Was it necessary to tell this story?" 
While I think it is okay to have an interracial team working on a project about The Underground Railroad, I do not think it should be selling point that the show has an interracial creative team. Based on watching the first episode, I think there is no unique perspective that the writers tell based on their background. Maybe this changes as the season develops but it did not do so in the first episode

# Questions
* How do you think the psyche of the bondpeople would be affected after truancy?
* Besides the actual act, what do you see as a difference between truancy and fugitivity?
* Which runaway story most interested you and why?
