### Overview

Camp, Stephanie M. H. “‘I Could Not Stay There’: Enslaved Women, Truancy and the Geography of Everyday Forms of Resistance in the Antebellum Plantation South.” 

- In this brief piece, Stephanie M. H. Camp discusses different types of resistance in the antebellum plantation south, namely truancy. Rather than trying to leave the plantation permanently by heading up north, many slaves left the plantations with the intention of returning. This form or resistance combatted the “geography of containment” slaveholders tried creating, employing movement as a weapon. Often referred to as “absentees” or “truants” by historians, these individuals would leave to escape severe punishments, see family members, or to leave the horrors of slavery behind oneself for a few days. Gender roles influenced this practice, as men generally fled the plantation more. Leaving the plantation, even if temporarily, was still dangerous, and many slaves were punished upon their return. 

McKittrick, Katherine. “Mathematics Black Life.” The Black Scholar 44, no. 2 

- “Mathematics Black Life” illuminates issues with the way we understand documents, data, and even images of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and American slavery. Katherine McKittrick notes that the majority of this era’s primary sources are infested with “scientific” iterations of black inferiority and degradation, such as “Black is naturally malignant and therefore worth of violation” (17). Constant exposure to these accounts can result in “Fanonian moments”, in which individuals focus on the horrific black legacy rather than our resilient people who fought for emancipation. McKittrick calls for the reader to “[t]rust the lies”: to question the realities often invalidated by the authors of these primary documents (“She says she is free”). Understanding slavery correctly requires the humanization of the analytical and the realization that the “project of freedom” is still “incomplete” (Hartman 25).

Video: Jasmine Cobb with Mark Anthony Neal on Left of Black

- Mark Anthony Neal interviews Jasmine Nichole Cobb, Assistant Professor in the Departments of Art History Art, Visual Studies, and African and African American Studies at Duke University about topics covered in her book ““Picture Freedom: Remaking Black Visuality in the Early Nineteenth Century”. Cobb critiques the biased depiction of blacks during the transition from slavery to abolitionism and emancipation. What she keys as the “white gaze” is the suggestion that the white outlook on slavery and the black experience was all seeing and all knowing. It was through this phenomenon that white Americans maintained their power structure during the transition to the 20th century and the black perspective was delegitimized. Nonetheless, blacks organized, representing themselves through fashion, painting, drawing and other visible mediums in spite of what Neal calls “hyper-visible invisibility”. Although African Americans have better access to visual representation, Cobb asserts that the notion that whites can “disseminate the organization of black images” in a way blacks can’t still plagues our society. Cobb continues to study African American culture and visual arts, planning to focus on the connections between 20th and 21st century freedom movements, black aesthetics, and black natural hair movements.

Anthony Chase to Jeremiah Hoffman, 1827, Baltimore 

- In this letter from Anthony Chase, a slave in Baltimore, Maryland, to his master Jeremiah Hoffman, Chase tells his master that he plans to run away. He apologizes for his actions, stating that if the conditions under his mistress Susan Williams, had been bettered, he would have stayed. Furthermore, Chase notes that he offered to pay Williams the price he was sold at with interest to buy his freedom, but was denied, and vows to pay her once he is free. He concludes the letter by wishing Hoffman happiness and good health, assuring him that his wife was not to blame for his actions, and explaining that he would leave to be free and to “[d]o justice to [himself] and to other and also to procure a liveing”. 
- Henry Lee Williams, in his will (ca. 1826), prompted the executors of his will to purchase Chase from Susan William “for the sole purpose of setting him free” and to give him “full freedom”. 

Runaways, Selections from the WPA Interviews

- These selections are transcripts of a handful of over 2300 interviews conducted by members of the Federal Writers’ Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), agency of the New Deal. Stories of the former slaves cover everything from actual escape stories to accounts of brutal punishments. One man, Cato Carter, enslaved in Alabama, fled with a man that a white man, Massa Oll, told him to kill. Another account by Amie Lumpkin, a former slave from South Carolina, tells the story of a man “lak a Cherokee Indian”, who even after President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, decided to stay with “Missus Mobley” until he was told to leave. She promised to pay his fare to wherever he wanted to go whenever he was ready to leave, and he left a few years later. There were also many images of the former slaves taken in the 1930s. 


### Reflection

- I learned a lot about aspects of slavery I was unaware of this week. I never knew about “truancy” and the way it combated the controlled environment slaveholders tried to create on plantations. Growing up, I never really thought of slaves having a multi-dimensional narrative, and in this week’s readings, we see a variety of perspectives of this era, from Anthony Chase, who tried to buy his freedom, and others like Cato Carter, who escaped. The WPA interviews were especially striking. It is so easy to isolate slavery as its own era hundreds of years behind us, but these interview transcripts from the late 1930s destroy that notion. It allows slavery and its implications to be understood as contemporary and relevant. 


### Expand

- I looked up the WPA Federal Writers’ Project Interviews on the Library of Congress website. There were 356 pages of the “Federal Writers' Project: Slave Narrative Project, Vol. 2, Arkansas, Part 1, Abbott-Byrd” alone. There were 17 volumes, some with multiple parts. After the project lost its funding in 1939, the volumes were bound and in 1941, became “Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves” (Washington, D.C., 1941). The image below is a screenshot of Emmett Augusta Byrd's interview transcript a former slave from Marianna, Arkansas, which is from volume 2 mentioned above. At the time of the interview she was 83 years old. The link to the online collection is [here](https://www.loc.gov/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/about-this-collection/) and the pdf of volume two can be found [here](http://lcweb2.loc.gov/mss/mesn/021/021.pdf).

Interview of Emmett Augusta Byrd by Irene Robertson") 


### Comment 

- Megan Huynh’s LL2 Question: I think this week’s readings can help us find the “true” history and story of slavery, at least within America. Personal accounts, especially those within the FWP Interviews, are devoid of the explicit “white perspective”, which often influences the “historical imagining of Africa” depicted in pop culture and even history books. Furthermore, I think we can better understand the true history by understanding prominent black figures in this era, like W.E.B. Dubois and Frederick Douglass, as more than intelligent anomalies, but as primary sources and irreplaceable contributors to black emancipation. 

### Questions

- Has anyone else hear of the WPA Federal Writers’ Slave Narrative Project? If so, where? 
- Katherine McKittrick says that we should “[t]rust the lies” within many accounts of slavery by white men and women. How should do we determine which “truths” are to questioned? 
- Many black movements are organizing on social media today, and use visual mediums as a means of resistance. Are these images, similar to what Cobb states, victims of the notion that whites can “disseminate the organization of black images” in a way blacks can’t?
