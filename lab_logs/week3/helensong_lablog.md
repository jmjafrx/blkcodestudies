##Overview

This week, we focused on readings about the reality of runaway slaves as well as a video about free Blacks before abolition, especially in terms of how they were portrayed versus what their situations were really like.

Stephanie Camp writes about the unique position enslaved women had as they were unable to run away to freedom compared to male slaves, tied down by their children, their place in Black families, their lack of learned skills, etc. However, they still resisted through "truancy," or running away short term. She highlights the importance and significance of this action of running away.

McKittrick discusses the mathematics of slavery, the slave system, and black life and what these hard facts and figures mean. She also works to ethnically engage with this data regarding economics, trade, etc. while also honoring black life, black death, and anti-black violence. One thing she brings up is the importance of trusting the lies of slaves, and understanding what they mean.

In an interview with Mark Anthony Neal, Jasmine Cobb discusses her research on lives of free African Americans before abolition, specifically on how limited the visual portrayal of them is. She found they were mostly portrayed as mean, aggressive, but that these portrayals contrasted with the information she knew about them.

In this letter, Anthony Chase addresses his former master, articulating his reasons for running away and offering compensation for his time not working. This letter shows a slave who clearly is eloquent and has a good command of the English language (despite spelling errors). Sentences such as "I dont take this step mearly because I wish to be free but because I want to do justice to myself and to others" shows very deep motivations for wanting to be free. 

The stories of runaway slaves are presented in the form of interviews with their children, neighbors, friends, etc. conducted during the Great Depression by the WPA. These interviews capture the true diversity of the slave experience, and show how slavery as an institution was extremely multi-faceted and complex. However, these interviews definitely seem to display a portion of these people as being less educated or having a lower command of the English language. 
##Reflection

It is extremely easy to fall for the Mammy and obedient, child-like slave stereotypes if you don't actively seek out other materials and media that portray the reality of slaves. Especially in terms of runaways, it was very interesting to find that slaves spent their entire lives resisting in the ways that they could within a brutally constricting and cruel environment. It was, however, also interesting to read narratives about slaves that actually were loyal to their masters.
It is truly devastating to see the complete lack of record and coverage of slaves and free Blacks as real human beings rather than caricatures or symbols. I was especially moved by Anthony Chase's letter because it felt like a real sample of how slaves thought and spoke and also showed how much their motivation for freedom was often a truly deep yearning for freedom. 
##Expand
Something that has always really intrigued me (and also depressed me) about American slavery is that it was fundamentally different from the many other forms of slavery that happened around the world and throughout history. Even in Korea (my home base), a historically 99% ethnically homogeneous nation, a slave system was in place until the late 1800s/early 1900s. However, what makes American slavery unique is that race made it an extremely concrete hierarchy in which people could not escape slave status without going through extreme measures. 

##Comment

I was also interested in a question that Channing posed about broken families and whether they found each other again/how they might have. I was especially curious about this because I realized that parents left their children not only when they were sold off but often had to leave behind children when running away as well. It really brings about the question of how this breaking apart of family units affected generations of slaves and their descendants. 
##Question
In one of the slave interview accounts, the interviewee mentions slaves running away to Mexico rather than to the North. Did this happen often?

When McKittrick began discussing the "arithmetics of skin," I began to have difficulty following along. What exactly is the significance of this science she discusses and the ways in which it "produce[s] the scourged back?"
