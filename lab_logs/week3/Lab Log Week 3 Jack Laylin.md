Lab Log 3

# Overview: 

### Anthony Chase Letter

A slave has been hired out to another master and has runaway. That slave, Anthony Chase, is writing to his original owner to explain Chase’s actions and describe the attitude of his mistress. Chase has decided to board a ship to make enough money to buy his own freedom. He hopes that his owner will understand his actions. It turns out that his owner’s will, upon execution, will pay for Chase’s freedom.

### Runaways

This is a series of interviews with previously enslaved runaways. One recounts the seven years a family spent living in a cave, completely self-sufficiently, after the parents ran away from the plantation. There is also much discussion of how to cover the train of the tracking bloodhounds. One interview details how a slave was told to kill another slave, but they decided to run away together during the Civil War. One of the most powerful stories was of Lincoln’s Emancipation. A slave heard the news and somehow felt compelled to stick with his master’s wife until the husband returned form the war.

> “Devils and good people walking in de road at de same time, and nobody could tell one from t’other.”

### McKittrick

The slave’s status as a commodity has allowed for a black archival presence. The piece struggles with the question of how to appropriately engage with data that represents and reinforces the black subhuman narrative. The author suggests a more visual approach, saying “access to new world blackness dwells on the archival display of the violated body, the corpse, the death sentences, the economic inventories of cargo, the whip as the tool that writes blackness into existence.” I think the author is saying that it is a difficult but not insurmountable challenge to employ anti-blackness data to understand blackness, but the excessively floral and verbose writing has obstructed my full understanding. 

### Camps

Camps details absentee female slaves and the gender discrepancies in forms of disobedience and desertion. Discretion of the overseers means that slaves could be punished in any way deemed necessary. When facing extreme violence, many women would flee the plantation. The female slaves engaged in truancy more often than they would run away. Because of their duties on the plantation and labor-supply responsibilities, women found it harder to run away completely. Sometimes, women would flee to surrounding woods in order to maintain proximately to their families while leaving slave life. This could be in reaction to sexual violence, which afflicted women disproportionately. The truants often relied on the assistance of the remaining plantation slaves in order to survive.

# Reflection:

I found it interesting that truants often relied on the assistance of their fellow slaves for survival. Considering how risky it was to be found in the aid of a runaway, it is surprising that slaves were willing to assist the truants. Regarding a Black data archive, I agree it is important to try to erase prejudice from factual histories. I do wonder, however, if it will ever be possible to separate that massive chunk of Black history from its inherently racist data. Finally, I just want to point out how apologetic Anthony Chase is for running away from the deplorable conditions he described after being hired out to another master. His narrative is a fine example of brainwashed subservience. 

# Expand:

I was thinking about the cotton-picking scenes from 12 Years a Slave and Underground and thought more about the work songs that the slaves sing. [This website](http://www.harriet-tubman.org/songs-of-the-underground-railroad/) has a great index of some of the best-known ones. 

# Comment:

I was the first to arrive!

# Question:

1. What incentive was there for slaves to assist truants and runaways? Were the communities that familial?

2. Can any line be drawn between truancy and MLK’s encouragement of civil disobedience?

3. Would someone like Anthony Chase struggle to acclimate to the free world when he can barely runaway without a second though?
