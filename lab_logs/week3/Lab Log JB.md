**OVERVIEW**:

Left of Black

In Left of Black, Dr. Neal interviews Dr. Cobb on her new publication Picture Freedom: Remarking Black Visuality in the Early Nineteenth Century. Dr. Cobb explained to Neal that her inspiration for this scholarship stems from her interest in the lives of free Black people in the early 19th century. In her research, she found that white illustrators of the free Black experience negatively depicted the lives of free Blacks in the antebellum period. This evidence contrasts with accounts of prosperous free Black existence that added fuel to abolitionist causes. Neal and Cobb remarked that such a phenomenon is an example of the white gaze, the idea that whites maintain a visual control on Black Americans through censorship and erasure of narratives of Black America that contradict white established notions of the Black experience.

Chase Letter

In this letter, Anthony Chase pens a thoughtful series of words to his former master Jeremiah Hoffman. Chase wrote that he run away to rid himself of the experience of living as a man with his “hands bound and his feet fettered.” Chase even claimed that had he been treated properly, he would have stayed with Hoffman. He offered to repay his master for the time missed. The letter reflects a degree of command of the English language, which suggest that Chase was a slave who knew how to read and may have interacted with free Blacks in Baltimore. 

WPA Runaways Stories

Running appears to have been more common than mainstream narratives of slavery lead students to believe. Many of the former slaves discussed the harsh punishments that masters and overseers inflicted on runaways. Something to take note of is of the overuse of the African American Vernacular in some of the written form of these oral histories. In the notes, the complier of these narratives encourages readers to consider question the motives of WPA interviewers and how the Black experience was meant to be remembered during this era. 

McKittrick Reading

McKittrick understands slaves as an economic system. Slaves represented commodity goods that were traded as frequently sugar, tobacco and other natural resources. McKitrrick wrote that she considers the Middle Passage as the foundation of the mathematics of enslavement. 

Camp Reading

Running was a common occurrence on southern plantations. However, these events were not always the harrowing journeys to northern freedom that have become the narratives of Black resistance to enslavement. Running became an expression of resisting the confines of plantation slavery. Slaves fled plantations for surrounding areas where they hid for days, weeks and months only to return to their plantation. 

**REFLECTION**:

Before reading the WPA stories, I did not consider how transcribers can manipulate oral histories. How do we know that these formers slaves spoke in the manner that they are depicted to have? I noticed that the transcribers perfectly captured (or so I thought) well-dressed former slaves, but used the AAVE for interviewees in tattered clothing. I though the exaggerated language of some of the interviewees distracted me from understanding their stories.

If you have not seen Tales from the Hood, then watch it this weekend. It is a Black horror anthology film with a surprise twist ending that has been imprinted in my memory since childhood. The photo above represents a scene from one of the stories featuring voodoo dolls possessed by deceased slaves who seek revenge on anyone seeking to disturb their slumber at the plantation. These dolls also have interesting eating habits. #violentresistance

**COMMENT**:

My comment is in response to Megan Lab Log # 2 comment. She argues against claims that Brad Pitt’s involvement in producing films with majority Black cast or those films depicting Black history is a white savior role. While I agree that Pitt is not intentionally a savior, Megan’s own statement that Pitt “realizes the immense talent that has not been emphasized in a white-dominated industry” contradicts her point. Her argument makes Pitt appear as a discover of Black film talent who presented otherwise ignored actors with opportunities of a life time. Her statement reads as one suggesting that without Pitt’s involvement, these actors of color would have difficulty finding roles. Pitt is a begrudging white savior who uses his industry influence to push for depictions of Black history on screen. While it is important that these stories are told, perhaps one day, Black filmmakers will have enough credibility to tell their own stories. 

**QUESTIONS:**
  

 - In the WPA document, there were many slave narratives from Deep South
   states, such as Texas. One interviewee mentioned that slaves in Texas
   did not think of the North as their promise land, but Mexico, just   
   over the Texas border. How often did slaves from the Deep South   
   escape to Mexico or even West?
 
 - In Anthony Chase’s letter, he demonstrates knowledge of English that 
   was not common for most slaves of the antebellum period. If   
   Anthony    is originally from Baltimore, what can we infer about   
   urban slavery    from his life? Are there privileges associated with 
   being a slave in    an urban environment that did not exist in   
   plantation society?


 - Why is it important to understand a writer’s, editor’s, transcriber’s
   or translator’s intention when review text that was    recorded
   orally?    Why is it important to understand if the author’s   
   verbal statement    affirm or contradict what has been written as   
   their words?
