##Overview

Camp

Camp's story discusses how truancy affected female slaves, and gave them a taste of hope for a free life. While male slaves often had valid reasons for leaving the plantation, female slaves were rarely given tasks that required setting foot off the plantation. For this reason, they would often run away onto paths that were only known by slaves. Camp describes Sallie Smith as a slave who ran away often to escape the abuse and exhaustion that was felt on the plantation. Although it was not common to run away as much as Smith did, many slaves did leave for periods of time.

McKittrick

McKittrick talks about how numbers are linked to slavery and urges scholars to not only speak of the horrors of slavery and the brutality of the master's punishments, but of the individual slave narratives and experiences as to focus on the people who were abused rather than the abusers. She wants to write blackness by "honoring but not repeating anti-black violence", which means that blackness should be studied and recognized, but should not be memorialized over and over as the violence that came with it.

Cobb

Cobb started out interested in studying free black folks, but was shocked to see representations that were negative towards free black people. The visual representation made by whites who were unhappy with the progress that black people were making made them into caricatures, rather than honoring and celebrating black freedom. She discusses the artistic practices of black individuals to study how black folks represented themselves as compared to the white people who represented them through the white gaze. 

Chase

Anthony Chase is an enslaved black man writing to his master about the fact that he is escaping on a ship to freedom. He apologizes to his master repeatedly, which shows the emotional abuse that came along with being enslaved. He reminds his master that he has served him faithfully, but it is time to be a free man.

"Runaways"

Runaways is a collection of interviews with formerly enslaved African Americans. They each talk about how they ran away and the process of the runaway trail that they and others took. They also speak of the punishment if a slave is caught running away and the reasoning behind making the risky move to go through with escape. Many of the former slaves mention that there is one breaking point event that leads slaves to make the decision to escape. 

##Reflection

These articles/video all focus on runaway and free slaves. It is important to have these narratives because they focus on the successes of enslaved black men and women, rather than repeatedly memorializing the horrors of the slave owners. While it is vital that the brutality of slavery is never forgotten, the honoring of slaves is achieved through remembering the triumphs of former slaves.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/13/entertainment/adele-beyonce-racism/index.html "Is Racism Why Adele Beat Beyonce" This article jumped out at me because while I was watching the Grammy's, I was stunned at Beyonce's beautiful performance and thought that she should have won album of the year. Apparently Adele thought the same thing. 

##Question

- Why do you think there was such a big difference between the black and white gaze that Cobb talked about in the video? Do you think white people noticed when they're being disrespectful and negative with their portrayal of freed slaves?
- How do you think Anthony Chase learned to read and write on the plantation? Although there are grammatical and spelling errors, the writing was up to par with many free white folks at the time.
- Why would Anthony Chase apologize to his master for running away when he doesn't plan on ever seeing him again?
