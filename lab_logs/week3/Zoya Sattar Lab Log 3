## Overview
‘I Could Not Stay There’ by Stephanie M.H. Camp presented another way of rebellion in the South beyond outright escape to the North. The words 'enslavement was captivity' made me stop and think for a moment on how true they were. One of the joys of being human is the ability to explore the world, to delight your senses with new experiences, and remember them for life. Yet what the slave masters did was entrap their slaves, prevent them from enjoying the things that make being human so enjoyable and exhilarating. A simple way, a short phrase, showing the intricacies and horrors of slavery. The immense pressure on women to stay with their children that still exists to this day. The complicated relationship between truants and their supporters. Their rebellion aided in eventual freedom, when mapping geography transformed from truancy to an aid for escape. 

In Left of Black with Jasmine Nichole Cobb and Mark Anthony Neal, they discuss how the only images of freed men from this time period were portrayed as only aggressive, instead of showcasing their actual work as building communities and fighting for abolition. She brings up the concept of the white gaze, and how what is needed is a black gaze. Her book Picture Freedom, Remaking Black Individuality in the 19th century, continues with the thread of separating the stories of freed and slave individuals in that time, as everyone had their own story and perception that helped weave together a more encompassing narrative.  

In Runaways, Selections from the WPA Interviews, the accounts all had the common thread of continuous fear and uncertainty for the escaped slaves future until they were well and truly free for a significant amount of time. This reading brought in a personal touch to complement Camp's excerpt on truancy. 

"Anthony Chase to Jeremiah Hoffman, 1827, Baltimore." A reading I had difficulty wrapping my head around. To read the very words a runaway had written to his previous master, to see how respectful he still was to a monster who had enslaved him. What level of brainwashing does it take to get to this point?

Katherine McKittrick in “Mathematics Black Life" continues with the message that black historians must acknowledge the diverse stories that make up the slave narrative. Her words on how the white living body is the mathematical measuring stick for the rest of us struck a cord. Her reiteration throughout her piece on the woman who 'says she was born free but was not free' is a very powerful statement.

## Reflection
The direct quotes from escaped and/or freed slaves makes tangible the topics we recently discussed in class, such as the fact that the times of slavery were about far more than violence. There were far more dimensions to slavery than just a single united narrative. There was quiet resistance, there was outright scorning of the system with truancy, there was mind-washed dedication to the 'masters'. There is far more to the history of slavery in America than the popular version toted around by historians.

A shout out here for the African Students Association holding an event on Islam in Baltimore next week!

The narrative of black Muslim slaves in America's history, and indeed the stories of those standing at the intersection of blackness and Islam in America is something that has been disregarded for too long.

## Comment
I agree with Ellie's comment that by stepping back from how we typically view history allows us to gain a deeper understanding and mastery of such a heavy topic, and that this is essential in the modern century.

## Question
What exactly would plantation owners do to have their slaves be so loyal to them/brain washed?
What more can be done to shift the focus away from the white body as a standard for everyone else to aspire to? 
When would be the appropriate age for the next generation to start learning more about slavery prior to graduating high school?
