# Overview
## Beyond the Hashtags: #Ferguson, #BlackLivesMatter, and the Online Struggle for Offline Justice
  Freelon, McIlwain, and Clark discuss the beginnings of the Black Lives Matter movement, which took off in 2014 in response to the video documented killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner in New York City. The hashtag itself began in 2013 after the acquitted trial of George Zimmerman for the murder of seventeen year old Trayvon Martin. The authors found that the goal behind the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was mainly to educate, amplify marginalized voices, and structure law enforcement reform. They researched tweets, web links, and interviews to find how the online movement influenced and hoped to influence offline justice.
## Black Study, Black Struggle
  Kelley studies why and how students from universities across the country banded together to protest the unjust killings of unarmed (and armed) Black men and women. He points out that Black college students were not immune to police violence and abuse, but that such a large scale demonstration in support of black lives had not been before seen on college campuses. Demands were created by universities for their administration to eliminate systematic racism that prevails on college campus. He points out that not only do black activists fight for black righst, but for other marginalized groups such as undocumented immigrants, trans folks, and queer identifying individuals.
## A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement
  Garza tells the story of how she and two other women created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in response to George Zimmerman's aquittal of the unjust murder of Trayvon Martin. The hashtag was meant as a call to action for Black people to stop the racism that is so prevalent in society and also, movements. She talks about how black, queer women's work is repeatedly stolen and manipulated without attribution and without respect. She discusses how Black Lives Matter is supposed to put marginalized Black folks at the forefront of the movement. That is, queer, trans, undocumented, disabled, women, and non binary identifying people were meant to be at the center of the movement.
## "Raving Amazons": Antiblackness and Mysogynoir in Social Media
  Crockett explains how the feminist movement has long excluded Black women and women other than cis, heterosexual, white passing women. She also describes the backlash received in response to Black Lives Matter and other Black activism. Black women have often been forgotten in many movements that have failed to acknowledge the extra opression that Black women face. She describes the way that people react to Black solidarity and the abuse that is faced online when Black people stand up for their rights, and how to stand up to white supremacists and racism deniers whether it be violent or non-violent.
# Reflection
  These articles all discuss the way the Black Lives Matter movement and Black activism in general have developed and the way the movement has been perceived and received. This is relevant to change in the U.S. because of the change in the way white people see racism as very prevalent in the lives of people of color all over the country. It has put racism at the forefront of discussion for the first time since the Civil Rights movement.

# Comment
  In response to Jack's question from last week, I think that the Oscar's this year made an effort to diversify the nominees, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they felt remorse. After the backlash from #OscarsSoWhite , I'm sure the Academy made a point to not have to deal with activists speaking out against their extremely non-diverse nominees and winnters. 
# Question
  1. Why do you think that a marginalized group such as Black males would knowingly ignore the plight of other marginalized groups within the Black Lives Matter movement?
  2. Why is the Black Lives Matter movement so much more well known than other Black activist movements? 
  3. Do you think that social media has encouraged more or less racism? It is easy to be racist when hiding behind a computer screen, but it is also easier to be called out online than in person. Which do you think has been more prominent?
