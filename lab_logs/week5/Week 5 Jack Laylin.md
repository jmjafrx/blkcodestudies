Lab Log 5

# Overview: 

### Sharpe

Sharpe discusses a succession of family deaths and the difficult economic and social circumstances of her childhood and college years. She speaks in terms of a “wake” or a consciousness of their plight but also a state of active pursuit of betterment. The author discusses the challenges she face after going from poverty to an Ivy League to a tenured professor position. Each new anecdotes sheds light on the harrowing events that have drawn her away from her own pursuits. Each of these events relates to living in the “wake” of slavery, which the author describes as a legacy, continuity, and praxis.

### Woods

Hurricane Katrina was a blues moment because it exploded systemic racism and its deniability. It also exposed the Bush administration’s lack of concern for disadvantaged minorities. The blues is a form of “social realism” that allows the black populace to investigate and interpret the world around them. The author uses the various themes of the blues in order to examine the Katrina tragedy. Much of the discussion revolves around the “Neoplantation System,” which is essentially politically masked anti-minority racism.

# Reflection:

I was confused as I read the florid and jargon-heavy Sharpe piece for the first time. After a second skim, I came away with a better understanding of the praxis she preaches. The overall thematic development of the word “wake” in its various conjugations is propelled by harrowing details of each family death. I agree with her assertion that the world is structured around anachronistic ideas of slavery that have evolved into the default race as white, gender as male, and class as middle. And I agree that he experiences support this finding overwhelmingly. I think that transplanting the “wake” theme into the Woods piece would have made it far more coherent. This is because the Woods piece is full of fantastic anecdotes about neoplantation politics, which sounds exactly like the “wake” of slavery. Woods also points out times that even allies like Barack Obama fell into the same tropes of black plight that only self-perpetuate the reality. Apparently, even our black ex-president is not beyond black “non-status” stereotypes!

# Comment:
I find it interesting that both Ellie and Zoya referenced the Oscars gaffe from Sunday night. I was recently reminded that the Academy is still overwhelmingly white (89%) and male (73%).

# Question:
1. Do you think any of the voters felt remorse for last year’s #OscarsSoWhite and paid more attention to diverse casts this year?
2. What do you make of the new DNC leadership’s commitment to diversity and protection of minorities?
3. Are there any cities that work to the exact opposite effect of New Orleans, i.e. consistently combat the “wake” of slavery?
