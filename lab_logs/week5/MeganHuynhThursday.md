# OVERVIEW:
In Beyond the Hashtags, the story of how #Ferguson and #BlackLivesMatter developed and spread through the highly publicized court cases such as Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and Freddie Gray. By analyzing the rhetoric of specific online communities, it revealed how the internet and social media impacted a nation-wide movement. 
In Black Study, Black Struggle, Robin Kelley discusses how the size, speed, intensity, and character of recent student uprisings caught much of the country off guard. In addition, she investigates the relationship between Black college students and their relationship with the university as a result of activism and reform.
Alicia Garcia tells her story about how she and her sisters created #BlackLivesMatter in response to the injustice of Trayvon Martin’s court case. She reveals how the slogan has taken other forms such as Our Lives Matter or All Lives Matter – and how those variations take away from the power and gravity of Black Lives Matter. In addition, she admits how the work she has done as a queer Black women has been discounted – in a way her work has not been as important or notable as powerful men. 
Raving Amazons also discusses the same topic that Garcia was distressed about – how Black women have been surveillance and harassed through social media. 
# REFLECTION:
I had never heard of the 4chan hoax and was extremely surprised by the investigation done on who was behind it. For me, I would not even think that people would pretend to be a certain race online in order to insight extremist rhetoric which would subsequently push moderates away from a certain movement. In addition, the “Why I Stalk Sexy Black Woman on Twitter (And Why You Should Too)” article was disturbing and creepy. It brings to light how men can still view women and in particular Black women as animals that are their prey.

This picture is of Black children near an alligator. I had seen this picture in a previous class. It circulated around the US during the Jim Crow Era because it was supposed to invoke a feeling that Black children were animals. The article about viewing Black women as animals made me think back to this picture – which is concurrent with the view that Black people are not really people but foreign creatures. 
# COMMENT:
Response to Teijiri. I believe the definition of wake – the mourning of death came first. Sharpe opened up the word wake to mean much more. In one way, wake can be your awareness of the underlying racism in society and in one way you are mourning the injustice of Black deaths. To me, this is the first form of how “woke” began to mean when a person is aware about social constructs. 
# QUESTION:
1.	Why are Black women more foreign than any other race? Does it have to do with our nation’s history or does this happen in other countries too?
2.	How has the Black Lives Matter movement continued to perpetuate for so long? Typically, hashtags are fleeting. What makes this different?
3.	Are Black students more politically active than any other race on college campuses?
