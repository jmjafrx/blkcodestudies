# Lab Log Week 6
* "Beyond the Hashtags: #Ferguson, #Blacklivesmatter, and the Online Struggle for Offline Justice" 
In the article Freelon et al. discuss the importance of social media within the Black Lives Matter movement. They argue that social media is key to the success of BLM because it provides a platform for individuals and organizations to disperse information and mobilize individuals. They also argue that people of color use use social media to leverage and fight back against institutional discrimination in the larger society. 

* "Black Study, Black Struggle" Robin D. G Kelley
In the article, Kelley states that protests and demonstrations are permanent fixtures in all college campuses. He argues that while it is a good sign that students are becoming more engaged, ultimately student activism is geared towards reforming practices instead of revolutionizing it. Here he discusses how students fight for a more inclusive campus by hiring more non white professors or admitting more non white students from different SES background. He argues that instead of a more inclusive space, students should fight to overturn the structural of their universities that allow for these problems to exist. He also says that student activism exists within a vacuum where once they leave the university setting, they are going to experience the inequality they fought for within their campuses.  

* "A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Graza" by Alicia Graza
In this article Alicia Graza, one of the founders of the #BlackLivesMatter, traces the development of Black Lives Matter. She states that BlackLivesMatter was created in response to racial discrimination within the United States. She also argues that BlackLivesMatter is a movement for everyone and the backlash of #AllLivesMatter misses the fundamental point of the movement. #BLM is not saying that black lives are superior to other lives, which critics of BLM often will argue, instead #BLM is a call for challenging racial discrimination both social and economic that has been the fabric of American society. 

* "Raving Amazons: Antiblackness and Misogynoir in Social Media" by I'Nasah Crockett
In this article, Crockett begins with a passage from Frank Wilderson to state that the structures of society are anti-black; that the very foundation of America society is based on the exploitation and marginalization of black people. She says in order to deal with the lived reality if an anti-black society, black people, especially black women, use social media sites as a way to connect to one another and share their lived experiences. While this is affirming and empowering in many ways, Crockett argues that it also can have harmful effects given the backlash they face in social media sites. Also important is how social media continues to every targeting and surveilling of black people.


# Reflection
After reading Freelon's piece on #BLM, I agree with their analysis on the difference of #BLM from #ArabSpring and #OccupyWallStreet. I think one another point I would make is how the success of #BLM over the other movements that were fueled by social media is the tangibility aspect of #BLM. Occupy and Arab Spring were successful in increasing the visibility of the movement by circulating real time news. in contrast, I think BLM provides this visibility but also provides tangible ways people can participate which is a reason why they are able to achieve results. To tie the other readings, if we think about Arab Spring and Occupy, students could share videos or news about events that were taking place but there was no platform for them to actually participate in that movement, in contrast BLM allows students to be participate in the movement by demonstrating, attending meetings and organizing. As time passes by I hope there are more pieces that talk about the link between social media and tangible actions because I think it is an important discussion to have when analyzing the success of social media movements.  

# Expand
Reading the Kelley article made me think about a conversation I had with my friend who is a leading activist in her campus. We discusses how universities often underestimate the emotional toll social activism takes on students and how professors should be more considerate of the interests of students outside the classroom and offer support through extending deadlines for coursework or altering the syllabus. 


# Comment
To answer Turoquoise question about creating diversity in the university, I think they are both related. To look at Hopkins as an example, for us to "celebrate" and "create" diversity requires us to take a closer look at the role Hopkins plays in reproducing inequality in Baltimore. Only once we recognize the shortcomings within the city and see how that reproduces inequality within our campus can we champion diversity and equality at Hopkins and in Baltimore. 

# Questions
1. As students in a city that has vast inequality and discrimination, do you believe we have a responsibility to be students activists outside the university? 
2. If you believe we should be advocates for Baltimore, how can we place demands that speak both to the condition of the university and our city?
3. How can we resolve misunderstandings people have about BLM? (i,e, AllLivesMatter backlash and how they think its exclusionary)
