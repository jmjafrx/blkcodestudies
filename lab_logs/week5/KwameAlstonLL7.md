This a very lengthy report conducted by Deen Freelon, Charlton D. McIlwain, and Meredith analyzing social media’s actual value in the national conversation surrounding the Black Lives Matter’s movement. They analyzed three types of data: 40.8 million tweets, over 100,000 web links, and 40 interviews of BLM activists and allies. Some of the man findings out of this was the #Blacklivesmatters hashtag did not become popular till the incidents in Ferguson despite being creating in July 2013.

In this piece Robin D.G. Kelly talks about the recent protest across college campuses nationwide. He supplements background on these events with his opinions. He thinks that the student protest must move past just wanting to be included in campus, an idea he thinks is contradictory to the movement. He pushes for activism to move to more radical demands such as schools devesting from prices and fair wages.

Alicia Garza, one of the queer black women that created the “blacklivesmatter” hashtag, gives a “herstory” about the formation and initial use of #blacklivesmatters. They talk about the formation and how when it picked up it was taken from them. People started to change the meaning or people would take their work without crediting them. She relates this to the Anti-Black movements in the world and talk about how the hashtag is a direct resistance to those Anti-Black movements.

This short article by l’Nasah Crockett explore how the global antiblackness attitudes have managed to infiltrated spaces of black women. Crockett talks about the history of antiblackness briefly and uses a few quotes to ground the concept. They show examples of white men using black women’s internet bodies as ways to further their ideas and derail movements. She also talks about defense against this form of violence.

##Reflection

The piece by Robin D.G. Kelly was very frustrating to me on various levels. I felt like he has demands for student activist that are unrealistic when thinking about the fact that students aren’t just activist. I feel like academics love to give demands that aren’t accessible to everyone. Just looking at his recommended reading you can see that he is recommending authors that are by no means easy to read. I think it is very fair for students to want to advocate for services that treat their trauma. I don’t have a problem with Kelly’s want to advance the forms of protest, but I think that needs guidance.

This is an article speaking to white supremacists posing as a black people. I don’t know if I was not informed about this incident or if it was not widely publicized by mainstream media; however, I find this to be one of the most shocking things we have read this school year. 

##Comment
In response to Tejiri’s question about the Clinton’s and the War on Drugs from LL6, I do not believe there will ever be an apology by them or on behalf of them. In order to apologize they would need to feel regretful for their actions. I firmly believe the only thing they feel bad about from the War on Drugs is the way their political reputations were tarnished (especially Hillary after 2 lost elections). Hillary had the chance to address it when the protestors interrupted her speech at a private Even in South Carolina while she was on the campaign trail. 

##Questions

1.	How is it possible for groups of white nationalist to infiltrate twitter pretending to be black woman for the purpose of using the “anger black women” stereotype to derail feminism not a national headline?
2.	How can foster safe digital spaces when we do not own any of the platforms and why do our platforms die so quickly despite that fact that blacks contiune to make socila media popular (blackpeoplemeet/ soul swipe)?
3.	 What are the first steps students have to make to move toward radical protesting?
