#Special Instructions for Your 2017 February 28 (Week 5) Lab Log

You still submit a lab log today. It will just be a little remixed: 

1. Overview - same as usual
2. Reflect - same as usual
3. Expand - Stop. 

--- git low, git low --- 

Then, instead of sharing an EXPAND in your lab log, you have two choices:

##Choice 1 - 

Choose a passage from ANYTHING we have read thus far that speaks to the following question: What are Black Machines or Black Tech? Tweet the passage--word for word, using "quotes," and, of course, minding the 140 character limit. The passage should be long enough for you to compose at least ten tweets (9 tweets of quoted text + 1 tweet giving the full citation of the text) but you are welcome to go past 9 tweets. DO NOT forget the citation. Last, but not least, do not tweet who you are, do not "sign it." Remain anonymous. 

##Choice 2 - 

Choose a passage from ANYTHING we have read thus far that speaks to the following: Dark Energy. Tweet the passage--word for word, using "quotes," and, of course, minding the 140 character limit. The passage should be long enough for you to compose at least ten tweets (9 tweets of quoted text + 1 tweet giving the full citation of the text) but you are welcome to go past 9 tweets. DO NOT forget the citation. Last, but not least, give the citation but do not tweet who YOU are, do not "sign it." Remain anonymous. 

Both choices require you to "takeover" @blkcodestudies. The username and the password are in the #twitter channel on Slack. Both choices encourage you to reach back--or time travel--to things we have already read and survey where it might fit in the past week's conversations.

Both choices mean you will not submit a #3 with your usual lab log--but, yes, you must still do a lab log. Include only 1, 2, 4, and 5. Leave #3 to Twitter.

4. Comment - same as usual
5. Question - same as usual
