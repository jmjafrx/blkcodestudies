## Lab Log #7 | Channing Kimble-Brown

### Overview

**"Beyond the Hashtags:# Ferguson,# Blacklivesmatter, and the Online Struggle for Offline Justice"**

* Deen Freelon and some other researchers did an extensive study of Black Lives Matter (BLM) as a general movement and how Twitter activism has shaped or been shaped by BLM activists and the networks that they are a part of. The researchers found that spikes in BLM activity on twitter were directly related to the events such as police brutality against black people or trials related to that violence. They also found that BLM activists, young black twitter, conservatives, mainstream news organizations, and black celebrities are the main groups that dicuss these kinds of issues and make up the sort of news network that helps maintain BLM's prominence. 

**Black Study, Black Struggle"**

* Robin Kelly strongly advocated for black students to learn about fugitive study and take as much as they can from the university. He sees this instituation as both a refuge and an oppressor complicit in the systemic racism that black students fighting for change really want. He feels that focus on mental health, safe spaces and cultural competency are getting away from the collective goal of black freedom since we're getting sidetracked by personal issues that are a bit easier for white people to find band aid solutions to and move on from. Kelly also wants us to focus on black people's history of resistance because while there was countless gross acts of human rights violations against black people, black people resisted and survived everything they've thrown at us up until today and will continue to do so in the future. His last remark was that black student activism must come from outside the university and must be an act of love and desire for freedom, not a desire to attain more power and status within a world set up by white supremacy.

**"A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Garza"**

* Alicia Garza wrote about the original purpose and creation of the movement she started, Black Lives Matter, and how that movement was co-opted and stolen. Garza and two other queer black women named Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter and later the organization Black Lives Matter Network after the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's murderer, George Zimmerman. Black Lives Matter was originally intended to be a rallying cry and support network for black activism against police brutality and the end of the oppression of black people. Unfortunately Garza has had to deal with people stealing her work with no credit or compensation to use for things like other movements, art, and advertisement. She explained that removing the "Black" from Black Lives Matter erases the entire foundation that black people built and ignores all of the problems that black people are facing while benefiting from black activist work. And on top of that the movement itself has become very much black cis male victims, not doing nearly enough to feature the marginalized communities within the black community that Garza originally intended the movement to fight for. 

**"'Raving Amazons': Antiblackness and Misogynoir in Social Media"**

* l'Nasah Crockett wrote specifically about black women on Twitter and how other twitter users have interacted with them. She says that Twitter has been great for building networks of black women but at the same time it has brought surveillance of black people to a whole new frontier. People from the left and the right (like 4chan) have been stalking and harassing black women online since the platform has been built. The right likes to infiltrate and try to convince outsiders that black women are causing problems and the left likes to observe black women's behavior and often get mad at black women for being upset when leftist groups are antiblack. This behavior from all over the political specturm trace back to the days of slave patrols and when all non-black people were deputized to watch and control black people. They can only justify treating black women this way by believing that black women don't feel any pain so the best way to survive is self-defense, because no one else is coming to help.

### Reflection

I really enjoyed these readings immensely, they reflected a lot of unarticulated thoughts and feelings I've had and seen discussed online about what the black movements of today have done well and where they are severely lacking. They condemn the focus on straight, black, cisgender, able-bodied men and the erasure and abuse of anyone falling in the more marginalized subsections of black people in the US. We hear about how black men are affected way more often than the black women and non-binary people that are dying or being harassed, especially black transwomen that are being murdered at ridiculously high rates. Beyond this, while it is abundantly clear from the readings that there are groups hell-bent on stalking black (often trans/queer/disabled) women, silencing them online and/or stealing their work for various reasons, these readings do emphasize the need for community support. The universities are not here for us, "allies" are not here for us, and sometimes people in the black community aren't even here for us so the disenfranchised within the black community really must rely on each other. One of the most positive things I'll mention taking away from this reading is the importance celebrating our resilience in African American history as opposed to focusing on the violence done to us as a people.

The tweets above are both from Janet Mock about the murder of Chyna Dupree and Ciara McElveen. They were murdered very recently in New Orleans and the fact that their names aren't circulating speaks to the problem that Alicia Garza spoke to in that the movement for black liberation is not nearly concerned enough with our more vulnerable subgroups.

### Comment

In response to Ellie's [first question](https://github.com/blackcodestudies/blkcodestudies/blob/master/lab_logs/week5/CreateStraussLL7.md), I think Alicia Garza said this better than I ever could but restricting the use of #BlackLivesMatter doesn't defeat the purpose because the only purpose should be to make sure everyone know that black lives matter. It is meant to uplift black people specifically and should be used as such. Other movements can and should take inspiration from black activism, and they have done so in the past and today. But trying to include other groups in this movement both dilutes the movement's goals. And there is no reason the other movements can't come up with their own campaigns. Black people will stand in solidarity with them but we shouldn't have to do the work for everybody. Especially when a lot of those other groups aren't treating the black people amongst themselves right.

### Question
0. What would be the best way to spread the radical black intellectual thought that Robin Kelly advocates for? What is the best way to get people truly outside of the university, people without college educations, to get involved in such radical activism? Or is it all on the black students and researchers?
0. Is it reasonable to expect black students that are serious about activism to separate mental health and politics?
0. Why aren't more people concerned about the fact that 4chan trolls dedicated time to infiltrating black women's spaces and impersonating them with the intention of discrediting feminism?
