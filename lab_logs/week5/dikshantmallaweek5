## Overview
* "Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?: Katrina, Trap Economics, and the Rebirth of the Blues, by Clyde Woods
Clyde Woods writes about the sociopolitical ramification of Hurricane Katrina both in New Orleans and within American society. He argues that Katrina reveals the absence of social justice and the "futility of the plausible deniability dance" practiced in America. Woods describes the "plausible deniability dance" as neoplantation politics. Neoplantation politics is rooted in Souther racist ideas, and that it operates in a covert manner. For example, the "Southern" strategy of the Republican party and for the most part the solidification of the Republican party post the Civil Rights movement is the epitome of neoplantation politics because the unification motive behind their social base is to maintain white supremacy. For Woods the aftermath of Katrina is an embodiment of plantation politics because the blame is directed towards poor, marginalized black individuals instead of racist politicians who treat their black constituencies as disposable and unworthy of aid. Furthermore, in the aftermath of Katrina Woods argues that there is a rebirth of the blues movement. Woods describes blues as an intellectual movement that fights to attain human rights and respect for those that are marginalized. Woods suggests that this "reincarnation" of blues is the most effective way to expose the neoplantation politics and reassert agency for black individuals currently labeled disposable. 


* "Chapter One" The Wake" from In The Wake: On Blackness and Being by Christina Sharpe 
A difficult read, the first chapter of Christina Sharpe's publication introduces us to the idea of "wake work". Sharpe has multiple definitions for the "wake" but from my understandings the "wake" is a recognition of black death and suffering in history and the present. Sharpe's argument is that we cannot view concepts of the "past" and "history" as static instead a more effective view requires us to see the linear progression of history to the present. While this is based on my limited understanding, I believe she is trying to make a structural claim about blackness; that in order to understand racial violence in the status quo (RE: surveillance, black as criminality, black as terror) it is important to start with an analysis of slavery and how the Middle Passage. I think her argument is that chattel slavery relegated black individuals to a position of subhuman or nonhuman. Even though chattel slavery is over, the society it produced is still in existence which means black individuals are still subhuman or nonhuman. Thus, there is a conflict between black subjects and American society that requires scholars and academics to study the Middle Passage to status quo as a continuum instead of fragmented, non related time periods. Sharpe argues that through this analysis she hopes that we can gain knowledge to ways of "re/seeing, re/inhabiting, re/imagining the world" and that through this praxis more work can be done to study blackness as ahistorical. 


## Reflection
* I really enjoyed Woods piece especially the part where he discusses neoplantation politics. One thing I am curious about is what the end product of Donald Trump's rhetoric of xenophobia and racism is. The more I thought about neoplantation politics the more I realized that Trump, and the current political climate is in conflict with this style of politics. Instead of making arguments about the flawed "culture of poverty" (Bill Clinton and republications arguments for cutting welfare in the 1990's), Trump's rhetoric and actions are quite transparent. I am curious about studying this because it was the same rhetoric of hate and racism that resulted in the wide-spread Civil Rights movements that eventually led politicians to adopt a more covert hidden racist agenda in the neoliberal era. I wonder if history is going to repeat itself.


##Comment
To answer Ellie's question about the Oscars, I think Sharpe would criticize the reaction post oscars where headlines are more centered around how La La Land lost rather than give Moonlight its due credit.

## Questions
1. Given the current political climate, can you identify instances of neoplantation politics?
2. What does the rejuvenation of blues look like in 2017?
3. Based on Woods article, how did Katrina change the way we view politics and society?
