## Lab Log 6: Turquoise Baker

### Overview

Sharpe, Christina, "Chapter One: The Wake," from *In the Wake: On Blackness and Being*

- In this chapter of In the Wake: On Blackness and Being, Christina Sharpe discusses various events occurring in her childhood and adult life. These tragic events, from the murder of her schizophrenic cousin Robert, and the inaccurate reports about the police stand off, to the murder of her sisters adopted 20-year-old son Caleb were not included without reason. Throughout this chapter, Sharpe strives to accentuate the normalization of Black deaths and how the lives of everyday individuals are “swept up in the wake produced and determined, though not absolutely, but the afterlives of slavery” (8). Being in the wake, Sharpe notes, should be understood as a “form of consciousness” (14). We must also think of ways to navigate the wake, which the author refers to as “wake work”.
 
Woods, Clyde Adrian. “Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?: Katrina, Trap Economics, and the Rebirth of the Blues.”
 
- Clyde Adrian Woods’ article focuses on systemic and environmental racism in Louisiana and Mississippi in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and the reemergence of blue and jazz culture. After the hurricane, many African American communities were left to their own devices, disregarded by policy makers including George W. Bush, whose FY2006 budget proposed cuts to programs critical for the survival of these communities. Some even saw Katrina as some sort of godsend: Richard Baker, Republican congressman of Louisiana, said, “We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans. We couldn’t do it, but God did” (1014). With individuals like Baker in positions of power, it becomes increasingly more difficult to advocate for Blacks in these areas and for them to have a voice.
 
### Reflection
 
- It took a moment to wrap my head around Sharpe’s metaphor with “the wake”, although one I began to understand it, I was able to appreciate it much more. It kind of reminded me of Chude-Sokei’s piece we read a few days ago. It seems like there may be a parallel between the dehumanization of blacks in terms of “primitive modernism” and in terms of thresholds to pain. The Silverstein quote Sharpe references (“‘People assume that, relative to whites, blacks feel less pain because they have faced more hardship.’...Because they are believed to be less sensitive to pain, black people are forced to endure more pain”) seems accentuate the normalization of Black dehumanization. (Silverstein 2013) (10).
 
### Comment

- @dikshantmalla I’m not exactly sure what the complete rejuvenation of blues looks like today, but I have seen many more artists using blues and funk and even jazz within their songs. Bruno Mars, for example, has a Motown vibe in many of his songs which has a strong blues influence. Artists like Jacob Banks (Dear Simone) and Aloe Blacc are heavily influenced by blues music. However, these are just mainstream artists. Although often obscured by the Top 40 cookie cutter songs, I think blues and jazz are still going strong.
 
### Questions
 
- Wood’s article spoke about genres like blues and jazz fighting contradicting forms of “cultural imposition”: one stating that the genres are universal, and another labeling them as auditory manifestations of “black savagery” (1014). Are there other things in our society (i.e., with black hair textures and hairstyles) that must fight various forms “cultural imposition” and even “cultural appropriation”?
- How much have these cities hit by Hurricane Katrina changed/not changed today?
- Have you witnessed/experienced the normalization of struggles of Blacks or other marginalized groups in your lifetime? Have they found ways to combat this systemic normalization? If so, how?
