**Overview**

Freelon/Beyond the Hashtags 

Freelon and the contributors of “Beyond the Hashtags” create the first comprehensive analysis of social media’s role in the Black Lives Matter movement. The researchers found that Alicia Garza’s original hashtag #Blacklivesmatter after the Trayvon Martin verdict did not yield the traction the hashtag has become associated with. #Blacklivesmatter grew substantially after the murder of Michael Brown, a product of social media’s assistance in spreading his murder to a wider audience. From then on, the hashtag has been a cornerstone of the movement for racial justice and against police brutality. One commenter considered the hashtags popularity has a sign that society is becoming more conscious and argued that “consciousness leads to action.” 

The researchers also framed the Black Lives Matter movement in the context of global anti-authoritarian movements such as the Arab Spring and the Occupy Movement, which I am not sure if such a comparison has occurred before. However, the researchers claimed that BLM demand specific reforms, compared to the abstractions of those two movements and engage with more mediums for change (press, policy makers, the public). Similarly, the researchers pointed to BLM’s extensive web network consisting of information ranging from hard news, sports news, entertainment news and cultural news. The most important takeaway from this report is that social media helps BLM level the playing field of disseminating information and allows the movement to compete with corporate and government structures to report authentic accounts of acts of violence of Black Americans. 

Kelley Article

Dr. Kelley spends most of his article describing what is wrong with contemporary student activism. He recognizes that Black student spurn recent activist activities on campus throughout the country. These students seek redress for their grievances for more Black students and faculty, lowered tuition, creation of safe spaces and cultural competency education. They are also off campus activists in the movement for law enforcement reformation. However, Kelley wants these campus radicals to understand that seeking inclusion in college and university structures will do little to change their conditions long term. Further, he claims that the university has no motive to include Black students, which is consistent with the university’s stance as a neoliberal order. If student activists seek true inclusion in their university system, Kelley urges, they need to champion “liberal multiculturalism” less and address their universities’ history of racism and inclusion, dispossession and injustice. Students must fight for a liberatory social and economic justice.

Garza Article

Alicia Garza provides readers with a brief history of the Black Lives Matter movement. She created the #blacklivesmatter to call attention to the murder of Trayvon Martin and to respond to anti-Black racism that she noticed and experienced. The movement began with few numbers, but association with the movement grew after the murder of Mike Brown. Garza says that it is humbling that other marginalized group want to mimic BLM’s successful activism model. However, she discusses an instance where a group sought to use the phrase “Our Lives Matter”, but deliberately excluded queer Black women, which Garza considers racist and hetero-patriarchal. One point that Garza wants anti-BLM agitators to understand is #BlackLivesMatter does not mean that other social groups are not important, but that phrase ties the entire liberation of society from white supremacy to Black Americans. Further, Black Americans do not need passive allies, but genuine supporters who engage in what Garza terms “active solidarity” and not superficial support. 

Crockett Article

Crockett considers antiblackness as the foundation of the contemporary world. To be anti-Black is to find one’s liberty, citizenship, humanity, and inclusion in the larger community of man. Blackness is on the fringe or an outcast in society. She says blackness is fungible, able to be replaced by another identical item or capable of mutual substitution. This fungibility invites violence, particularly against Black women. Crockett finds that Black women take refuge from anti-Black violence through social media use. Platforms such as blogs, chat sites, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr offer Black women communities of love and camaraderie, like physical spaces such as hair salons. However, even on virtual platforms, Black women are still surveilled, a product of society’s anti-Black hysteria and wanting to know what Black people are doing at every movement. One case of surveillance against Black women, trans women, and other marginalized groups was used to create fake Twitter accounts to take aim at white feminism. A year went by before someone noticed that these accounts where not by Black women, but by white men. 

**Reflection**

Garza made the distinction that Black Lives Matters and #Blacklivesmatter are separate. Black Lives Matters has an organizational structure with satellite branches that is not as in disarray and the media would lead one to believe. #Blacklivesmatter it seems is the movement that the organization developed from. 

While I agreed with many of Dr. Kelley’s arguments, I get the impression that he is not involved in any street activism, but prefers to use the pen as his voice against oppression. That is his choice and I am sure he is great at crafting an argument of indictment against university oppression. However, I read his article more of as the older uncle who has been through life seeking to teach the “youngins” a thing or two about why it is they are wrong about whatever the uncle deems wrong. We all know that the uncle may make sense, but often speaks without providing guidance or assistance. 

I thought Kelley’s suggested reading list was a great start, but even that list assumes a certain knowledge or forces student to adopt a set of politics that if not groomed into can be lost or misguided. I think professors need write less and assist students in these endeavors towards political radicalism. You cannot read CRL James with a group of undergraduate students. It is not a George R. R. Martin novel. It requires a level of analysis that I am not sure undergraduates can conclude without someone who has studied radical works so that the messages are misinterpreted. 

**Comment**

I am responding to Meghan’s third question. I argue that Black student must be more politically engaged than their non-Black counterparts on college campus. Social justice movements have started out of the suffering of Black bodies. That is the historic trend. Activism became a tacit obligation of the Black student even as he or she navigates other matters of their life. At PWIs, I think there is an even greater urgency for Black students to engage in activism. When Black students are complicit in their condition at the university, administrators became emboldened by that. When marginalized people are compliant, they are more at risk than they are as activists. Compliance assumes that there are no problems to address. At least activism allows other students, faculty and administrators to consider that problems exist.

Since we read of the white man proudly stalking Black women, I wanted to find a video that would act as a response to such an action. 

**Questions:**

1. On Dr. Kelley urgent call for radical campus politics, do you think his advice can be applied to Hopkins? What sets the university apart from other institutions, particularly its student body’s commitment to these issues?

2. Will historians remember the Black Lives Matters movement in the same vain as the Civil Rights Movement? What events must occur for such to occur? Do you expect to read about the Black Lives Matters movement in an American history textbook? 

3. How does Twitter and other social media act as archives for documenting contemporary social movements and replace the more traditional means of archiving (ie: library research)? Is social media a less elitist archive than a university library or the Library of Congress?
