# OVERVIEW:
The Sharpe article discusses how the wake can be interpreted in many ways beyond a funeral. The wake can be interpreted as the mourning of the death of her many relatives as a result of racial injustices. The wake can also be interpreted as the awareness of the racism that cuts through the lives of Black families pursuing a life of comfortability at home, work, and school. The Woods article discusses the Federal indifference to responding to the victims of Katrina and how those actions exemplified the underlying racism in America and its politics. The Blue resurrected itself in this historic area in order to confront the everyday efforts of the Black communities to regain their fragmented communities from white leaders and communities. 
# REFLECTION:
I did not agree with Woods in describing the Red Cross camps as “concentration camps”. If the parallel was to be made with the Holocaust, I think it’s an overstretched comparison. The scenario in which the Red Cross camps sold leftover supplies to the “penniless blacks” would justify institutionalized racism – in which a government or organization is systematically preventing Blacks from getting what they need. Concentration camps would almost replicate slavery. 
# COMMENT:
In response to Dikshant’s reflection about neoplantation politics. I agree that neoplantation politics has resurrected through the Republican party especially in this year’s election. However, I disagree that it has presented itself again in the opposite form. I believe that it is the same problem stemming from racial pressures of white supremacy dating back to slavery. 
# QUESTION:
1.	The Woods article criticizes the Bush administration; under the Trump administration would Woods think the circumstances of underlying political racism will change or perpetuate?
2.	Although Mississippi and Louisiana are known for being poor states, how are they able to create high performing sports teams in their universities such as MSU or LSU?
3.	How did Sharpe’s father come from a middle class family and fall to a lower-working class family? Did the circumstances of racism have a role in this?
