## Lab Log 7: Turquoise Baker

### Overview
 
Freelon, Deen Goodwin, Charlton D. McIlwain, and Meredith D. Clark. “Beyond the Hashtags:# Ferguson,# Blacklivesmatter, and the Online Struggle for Offline Justice.”
 
- The success of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement (not synonymous with #BlackLivesMatter) attests to the notion that “social media uniquely benefits oppressed populations” (8). The report is “aimed at an education, but not necessarily academic, audience” (9). It is not a “work of advocacy”, and although the authors agree with the message of the movement, they aim to condense information about it rather than promote it in the piece. The authors primarily study the use of twitter, and divide Twitter data into nine periods of defining events, including the post-Ferguson protests, the death of Freddie Gray, and Daniel Pantaleo’s non-indictment.

- Sites in the Black Lives Matter Web Network (Blacklivesmatter.com) are primarily news sites. Approximately 50% of all sites in the Network are focused on race, with a few targeted towards youth.

- The Twitter data set used in this study contained over 40.8 million tweets by over 4.4 million unique users between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015 containing “at least one of 45 keywords related to BLM and police killings of Black people under questionable circumstances” (21). Tweets about police violence and even the BLM movement are fairly episodic. The following communities, labeled subjectively by those conducting the study, were the most active on issues relating to the BLM movement at the time of the study: “BLM, Anonymous/Bipartisan Report, Black Entertainers, Conservatives, Mainstream News, and Young Black Twitter” (24). Other categories used in social network diagrams include but are not limited to Anonymous, Black Media, Journalists, Vice, International Solidarity and Mainstream News.

- The conclusion of the report addresses to the predominately Black voice the movement has managed to maintain, and provides more details on the voices of the victims and the youth. Unfortunately, women are often excluded in the movement, marginally represented in hashtags and tweets compared to men. The authors hope that the report will be discussed “both on-and offline” (84). The entirety of the Twitter and Web data was released January 1, 2017.

Kelley, Robin D. G. “Black Study, Black Struggle.” Boston Review, March 7, 2016.

- Kelley’s article, “Black Study, Black Struggle” condenses a few of his observations of the college campus protests of this past year, primarily regarding the “contradictory impulses within the movement”, for instance, the contestation “between desiring to belong and rejecting the university as a cog in the neoliberal order”. Robin D. G. Kelley suggests that the increase in activists and activist movements on university campuses is not just inspired by the police killings of unarmed black men and women, but the inability of campuses to provide safe and supportive spaces for students of color and the obstinate culture of “structural racism and patriarchy”. Changing these institutions not just mean frivolously adding more black students to the pool, but actively investing in a comprehensively diverse and sustaining environment. However, Black students must remember that although trauma may render them victims, there are still active agents, and must take all opportunities to learn, study and love.
 
Garza, Alicia. “A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Garza.” The Feminist Wire, October 7, 2014
 
- This article is written by Alicia Garza, co-creator of the #BlackLivesMatter tag with Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi after the death of Trayvon Martin. However, she does not speak as much about the creation of the tag as she does the misuse, and meaning behind the tag. #BlackLivesMatter was created to acknowledge the Black struggle in this nation. Watering it down to, for example, “All Lives Matter”, to become more “inclusive” strips the tag of all meaning. It “erases black folks from the conversation” and treats the legacy of Black liberation movements as unimportant. Garza concludes by asking that we not change this conversation, but take part in it.
 
Crockett, I’Nasah. “‘Raving Amazons’: Antiblackness and Misogynoir in Social Media.” Model View Culture.  
 
- In “‘Raving Amazons’: Antiblackness and Misogynoir in Social Media”, I’Nasah Crockett studies antiblackness, especially towards Black women on social media platforms. In one instance, a group of white women created 4chan.com accounts posing as women of color and sporting the #EndFathersDay tag, trying to create a bad name for feminists within marginalized groups. Women of color have been described as “loud”, “obnoxious” and “toxic” by many individuals and groups today, and hundreds of years ago (“is this 2010 or 1910?”). Antiblackness attempts to strip Black men and women of their integrity and their words of their legitimacy. However, in the face of this “antiblack world”, Crockett states, women of color must defend themselves.
 
### Reflection
 
- My favorite article in this set was definitely Robin D. G. Kelley’s “Black Study, Black Struggle”. I’ve seen dozens of articles that speak about the same issues, namely Blacks within the higher education system, but very few call for Black students to act as agents rather than as reactionary victims. And there is reason for that. Many people get so caught up in the plethora problems that they forget to even try and strive for a solution. Thankfully, we are beginning to see more of this agency from Black communities, and especially within colleges and universities. Furthermore, being Black in a college or university is not something to be taken lightly, and it is a privilege. Now, this is not to say that every Black person in college should be mandated to drop everything and become an activist. In fact, one’s race should never “obligate” anyone to do anything. But, those who want to take part in the movement, especially in schools like Hopkins, must not just look for the system to change itself but invest in him/her/themself to obtain the tools to make the change.
 
### Expand
 
- I looked into Robin D.G. Kelley a bit more on bostonreview.net and found many of his [other published articles](http://bostonreview.net/author/robin-d-g-kelley) on the site. [“Neoliberalism’s Challenge”](http://bostonreview.net/challenge-neoliberalism), posted in response to a forum question, was rather interesting. I usually think of Neoliberalism as a World Trade Organization or World Bank scheme, especially during the late 20th century. He highlights some concrete examples of Neoliberalism in the United States (present and past).
 
### Comment

- In response to Channing’s question in Lab Log #6, I think that wake work must cannot exist without black consciousness, but black consciousness can exist without the wake. I was a bit confused on parts Sharpe’s analysis, but I feel like one can easily get swept away by the wake and not fight it, while still being aware of their presence within the wake, that self-awareness being black consciousness.
 
### Question

- Why don’t we hear more about injustices facing Black women like we hear about Black men in mainstream media?
- Did reading the “Beyond the Hashtag” report change the way you think about social media, or even the way you may market or publicize a movement? If so, how? If not, why?
- How can we create a university that celebrates diversity of all types and strives for inclusion, while not creating a polarizing environment within Baltimore and United States?
