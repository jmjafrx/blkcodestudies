#Lab Log 7: On Hashtags and Mass #BlackLivesMatter Protests

##Overview
###**Freelon, Deen Goodwin, Charlton D. McIlwain, and Meredith D. Clark**
Beyond the Hashtags: #Ferguson, #Blacklivesmatter, and the Online Struggle for Offline Justice

In this article, the writers analyze the background behind hashtags such as #Ferguson and #Blacklivesmatter and why they incited such an animated conversation about race today. They examined tweets, web links, and interviews to understand how and why the hashtags gained the mass popularity they did, how activists used social media to share their ideas and movements, and how and why different minority and age groups responded how they did. They discovered that most people used social media to discuss these issues in hopes of educating others, inciting police reform and increased awareness, and using it as an outlet to express their anger, frustration, and sadness. They conclude their article by explaining that modern, cross-media studies of this kind are very important and instructive especially today to understand the common sentiment among people and what means are used most commonly today to inspire change and reform. 

###**Kelley, Robin D. G. “Black Study, Black Struggle.” Boston Review, March 7, 2016.**

Rioting on college campuses is not a new means of inspiring reform and change, but the intensity and number of recent student uprisings led by students of color, LGBT, and immigrants has surprised the country. Kelley highlights the contradictory aspects of these uprisings, such as the small number of Black students rising up against the university but still hoping to be accepted, and intends to understand what motivates them to be such strong activists. They push for an increasingly welcoming environment for students of color such as safe spaces, mental health support, and a general supportive environment for every type of student. But even after these kinds of protests take place, minority students continue to face backlash and unequal treatment. Institutions like universities do not enact social transformation; it is the role of the activist students to inspire change that oftentimes takes place outside the university. She argues that Black resistance much begin with love, just as Baldwin encouraged people to love all which means end exploitation and oppression everywhere. Students demonstrating on university campuses challenge the current norms that make minorities feel left out in university and daily life settings. It takes more than inspiring viral hashtags or speaking out: it takes active approaches to challenge the norm. 

###**Garza, Alicia. “A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Garza.” The Feminist Wire, October 7, 2014.**

Alicia Garza explains the process and thinking behind creating #BlackLivesMatter in the aftermath of Trayvon Martin’s death. Before she and her fellow creators knew it, the hashtag was everywhere and was being adapted into all forms of use and meaning. She describes being surprised by how people used their ideas, from expanding it to apply to women’s’ lives, migrant lives, as well as using it as inspiration for artwork. She describes constantly feeling as through she is fighting against White supremacy, but even against fellow Blacks who have not yet joined this national Black liberation movement. She emphasizes the idea that #BlackLivesMatter exists as a movement for all lives, not just black ones, to acknowledge apply to other movements and groups. 

###**Crockett, I’Nasah. “‘Raving Amazons’: Antiblackness and Misogynoir in Social Media.” Model View Culture. Accessed January 12, 2017.**

I’Nasah explains the centrality that Antiblackness has in our society today. He particularly focuses on its presence in social media, He sees social media as another “beloved black community” just like salons, restaurants, churches, and kitchen tables. He goes on to discuss the role of surveillance and policing of Black social media movements, and how this surveillance can be traced back to police in the mid 19th century whose sole job was to track and find runaways. This continuity across history can also be seen in how black women are treated in the media and on public forums like twitter: they seem to have an infinite tolerance for pain and no way to defend themselves, for any self-defense is seen as an unwarranted attack.

##Reflection 

These readings have put many of the so-often discussed activist movements in perspective. I had always thought of the mere common discussion and awareness of popular movements like #BlackLivesMatter as an important step in the right direction of recognition and awareness of the problems at hand, but this is a naïve understanding of the current events. After reading these articles, I realize the deeply engrained problems our society deems as normal today. Having Black students enroll at a certain university does not mean it is a diverse University: the way that they are treated compared to White students at the same university determines whether the school and community is diverse or not. I commend students who attend predominately Black Universities such as Spellman, Howard, and Morehouse to place themselves in a welcoming, socially normal environment where all students receive the same attention, care, and support that Black lives are important to everyone’s liberation. But it is important to realize that the #BlackLivesMatter movement is not just for all lives, but BLACK lives, and to not use it to.

This is the homepage of Trinity School, the school I went to from K-12. Every annual calendar they made included photos of majority minority students, even though our school was clearly dominantly white. 3/4 of the images shown on the homepage show minority students interacting with others, which serves to highlight the community's diversity, even though every grade is majority white. 

##Questions 

1.	Is discouraging #BlackLivesMatter to applying to other activist movements such as LGBT and feminist movements defeat the purpose of movements of this kind that should all be combined to challenge existing inequality? 
2.	Are riots that insist on the name change of certain halls, programs, and quads named after slave owners and racist historical figures also included under #BlackLivesMatter movements? 
3.	How does Hopkins fit in with the inequality and discrimination Robin Kelley describes on college campuses?
