# Overview
These readings highlight black death, its inputs (Woods), and its outputs (Sharpe).

Sharpe illustrates the concept of a “wake” with the personal anecdotes of losses within her family. Her experiences frame the “wake” as the legacy or aftermath of trauma, which can include celebration, profound sadness, and self-improvement. Here, she wonders what can be done within wake theory, or the idea/performance/meditation of coming to terms with loss, to access and honor the memory of those bodies lost in the Transatlantic Slave Trade.

The Woods reading dives into the historical and economic components of the racism that contributed to making the FEMA response to Hurricane Katrina as poor as it was. Woods examines how social philosophies, institutional baiting, and arguments of savagery were to tear down the black community in New Orleans. Woods uses the blues as a framework of sorts to call upon a painful historiography otherwise ignored in America, and places it opposition to neoplantation politics.

# Reflection
I found Woods’ piece striking salient, especially now given George W. Bush’s gradual return to a public that has warmed up to him considerably since President Obama’s inauguration where a crowd of thousands sang “Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye!” It seems as though the historiography that Woods mentions that would ignore the blues questions in exchange for a period of triumphalism has manifested itself in modern society. 

# Comment
@Tejiri it took Martin O’Malley espousing treatment over criminalization for heroin users during a national debate for me to realize that no, no one would apologize for the war on drugs. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders agreed too, but just knowing personally the destruction that O’Malley’s war on drugs policy created in Baltimore and the ripple effect that its had up to this past summer’s Department of Justice report, I thought he must be delusional to say that. But he wasn’t, because he continued along the campaign trail as though nothing had happened and will probably run for president again in 2020.

# Question
* How much has triumphalism changed our view of George Bush?
* What were some of the positive stories coming out of New Orleans after Katrina? How do you view them now?
* Does the wake ever end? The wake of slavery? Personal wakes? Or are we always working through them?
