# Overview: 

### Beyond the Hashtags by Deen Freelon et al.

In Beyond the Hashtags, a group of researchers apply analytics to social media activism. In analyzing trends, tweets, and replies in the wake of #Ferguson and other major events, they find that Twitter was instrumental in spreading stories of police brutality and eliciting reactions and activism from disparate communities.

### Black Study, Black Struggle by Robin Kelley

Robin Kelley interrogates the black college student on their struggles and activism. In the aftermath of Michael Brown, Freddie Grey, et al., Kelley studies the University’s status as a mechanism of social change. He also criticizes the framing of the black experience as one of trauma, “where words such as trauma, PTSD, micro-aggression, and triggers have virtually replaced oppression, repression, and subjugation.” He mostly comes to the conclusion that the university cannot be a place of enlightenment and social change because it seeks to profit from the antithesis. However, the university can be a breeding ground for the kind of movements that lead to change outside the university.

### A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Garza

Alicia Garza describes the genesis of the BLM movements. From an early hashtag on Twitter to a more formal movement, she faced many challenges in keeping the hashtag on-message. She then goes on to defend her exclusion of non-POC people from the movement’s aim, which has been appropriated in poor taste as #AllLivesMatter or #BlueLivesMatter. Essentially, it’s about honoring the legacy of the movement, black achievements in social justice, and that non-POC people simultaneously are affected by anti-Black racism and benefit from it.

### Raving Amazons by I’Nasah Crockett

Crocket discusses the legacy of slavery in our modern society. An anti-black anxiety plagues the white supremacist society—a vestigial structure of slavery that remains ingrained in everything from crossing the street to our police force. The author also describes a despicable 4chan ruse to alienate white feminists and disempower and discredit black feminists. This is a startling example of anti blackness and the language used to defend it reverts to savage stereotypes from the 17th and 18th centuries

# Reflect:

I think applying scholarly data analytics to social justice will be an incredible powerful tool for future movements. Social media and 24/7 news have completely altered how we come to terms with daily transgressions, and therefore the appropriate response must be changed and studied as well. There is no longer a “playbook” for social justice movements, because we are really treading on new ground logistically, perceptually, and socially. I was extremely surprised by the last article and the 4Chan hoax. I know the internet produces some truly awful things, 4Chan being the great originator of many of them, but this is giving me a concrete example. The follow up article from the leftist publication, unfortunately, plays to the sort of “fake news” sensationalism we now see daily.

I found a really cool, although quite simplified, infographic laying out the data from the Freelon research report!

# Comment:
I want to echo Megan’s question about the continued success of the BLM movement. I think Garza et al.’s professional organization is one of the main reasons that it has stayed at the top of news cycles. BLM has even transcended its original medium and followers to become a catch-all term for black social justice movements.

# Question:
1. Do straight cis black men like Obama as the faces of movements make social justice more palatable and effective or do they redirect the attention away from the subjugated minorities within the subjugated minority?
2. What do events like the “Forum on Race in America” at Hopkins accomplish? Is this just, as Kelley said, a cheap and easy way of quieting critics of racist institutions?
3. How lively is the BLM community at Hopkins? Does it crossover with Baltimore much?
