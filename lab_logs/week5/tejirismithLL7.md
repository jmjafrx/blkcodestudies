# Overview 

* Beyond the Hashtags: #Ferguson, #Blacklivesmatter, and the Online Struggle for Offline Justice by Dean Freelon, Charleton D. McIlwain, and Meredith D. Clark

This report is sectioned into 16 parts: an introduction, an overview, nine Twitter periods, a 
conclusion, and three Appendices. As a whole, this report goes over the data found in public tweets that contained certain keywords from June 1, 2014 to May 31, 2015. Within these tweets a number of hyperlink connections, Twitter communities, and themes are formed to make understanding the data much easier. One aspect that directly connects to this class is how the three authors/data-analysts focused on the progression of the Black Lives Matter movement and hashtag throughout the span of the year they chose. This report focused mainly on the actual tweets of users during these nine periods and mostly strayed from individual bias or opinion, making it fact-driven.

* Black Study, Black Struggle by Robin D. G. Kelly

In this article, Kelly begins by first recognizing the importance of collegiate facilities like the construction of safe spaces, the importance of diversity workshops, the existence of improved mental health resources, and etc. She sees the protests happening nationwide on and off college campuses and gives them credit where it is due, however after establishing all the good that modern poc at universities have engaged in, she begins to critique the methods that many administrators tend to gravitate to. She describes these multicultural programs as essentially not enough, and claims that they assume that racism was a problem of ideology, instead of hard institutions. She criqtiques the modern university for using a tap out method for ridding their schools of racism and offers what she considers good examples of what to do instead. 

* A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Garza

Throughout this article, author and co-founder of the hashtag #Blacklivesmatter, Alicia Garza, discusses the importance of not only the hashtag and the movement that has accompanied it, but also the fact that it is for, and was created by, black people. Garza emphasizes repeadtedly, that taking the term and changing "black" to "all" or "brown" erases the fact that the hashtag was meant for all intersections of black people, only continuing the same racist culture that the term is trying to work against. She also mentiosns that with the success of the Black Lives Matter movement, comes the success of other marginalized groups. Another point that is heavily mentioned throughout the piece is that black queer women and those of other genders are tyring to put out a voice that is repeadtedly stomped on by what Garza called the hetero-patriarchy. The focus on these topics captured the singular message that Garza was putting out: ignorning black struggles obviously hurts black people, but also everyone else.

* "Raving Amazons": Antiblackness and Misogynoir in Social Media by I'Nasah Crockett

I'Nasah Crockett discusses the antiblack rhetoric that runs rampant through social media in the mouths of white feminsts and internet trolls alike. In her article she begins with a description of what exaclty antiblackness is and how it has manifested itself in the deaths of too many black individuals. She then moves on to how this antiblackness is seen throughout social media, and how the merging of surveillance and misogynoir resulted in racist and stalkerish articles and the fabrication of the hashtag #EndFathersDay, made to be something that black women created. She explores these instances and relates them to narratives written in the 1900s (so racist narratives) and how their language is all too similar. Crockett's exploration of the combination of racism, sexism, and white supremacy all by the means of social media outlines a largely shared reality for black women.


# Reflection

Reading these articles and reports did not really present me with information that I wasn't alreayd at least slightly versed in. Having spent 18 years as a black woman in the United States, primarily in white majority spaces, erasure of queer women and surveillance of black women are not new topics. However the one article that did strike me a little more than the others was Robin D. G. Kelly's about the role of the unversity. I was happy when she cited the sentence about stealing from universities, just because as I was reading I felt that tone, however it did make me think more on the topic than we discssed in class. She made points that were all very true, most of the actions that universities are taking to improve black life on their campuses are fairly easy to do and don't address the core problem. But will the problems that she's presenting really be fixed by free tuition? I like to think that it would definitely boost the average black person's situation but sometimes I feel like attacking the core problem of white supremacy doesn't start with us doing more, but instead white people doing more among themselves. It's a really complicated issue that has way more layers than it gives on, so that's really just my limited proposal to a problem that I don't fully understand yet, but I figured that I might as well mention it.

I don't really know if this counts as something I'm allowed to do, but during high school (my sophomore year are when the following videos were written/competed with) I was really involved in the Louder than A Bomb Great Plains slam poetry circuit, and I wrote two poems that I feel like are applicable to this week's readings

# Comment 

One of Kwame's questions involved whether we think woke is a term that has become overused and it's meaning lost and I think the short answer is yes, however stopping there wouldn't be completely accurate. The term work, or at least from my personal encounters with it, has become a word that is being capitalized on. Surprise, surprise, I know. And while it has been in a way that supports black artists, which is something I clearly don't have an issue with, it also exists in stores like forever 21 in a context that betrays its original intent. A classic case of manifest destiny syndromw, or the Christopher Columbus effect, or neocolonialism, or literally whatever one would like call "white people walking in and 'claiming'/'discovering' a concept/ideolgy/culture that doesn't belong to them." Another way I've seen the word morph is just through its rampant use by white feminists. Articles written by them or tweets made by them all use it in the same exclusive way their ideologies are set up, making for a frustrating, yet unsurprising use of the word. 


# Questions

* Within the 9 Twitter periods, do you think the absence of keywords made for an incomplete rendering of the social unrest that was documented in the timespan of one year? What keywords, if any, would you add to make a more complete report?

* When facilitating true racial change, should we push the oppressor to fulfill most of the work or the oppressed? Who ends up doing the work?

* Is a "post-racial" society possible given the United States' background?
