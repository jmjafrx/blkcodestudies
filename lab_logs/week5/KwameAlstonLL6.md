#Lab Log 6 - Kwame Alston
##Overview

*	Sharpe, Christina, "Chapter One: The Wake," from In the Wake: On Blackness and Being, Duke U Press, 2016

She explain five different interpretations of the word "wake" past the general definition associated with the funeral process. She attempts to support this with very personal anecdotes that deal with tragedy and the death of loved ones. She explores the effects of not valuing black lives and how that is seen in the way students are apathetic towards the narrative of slavery.

*	Woods, Clyde Adrian. “Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?: Katrina, Trap Economics, and the Rebirth of the Blues.” American Quarterly 57, no. 4 (January 3, 2006): 1005–18.

Woods begins this article classifying "the Katrina tragedy" as a *blues moment*, an event that highlights the struggle in life. She believes that this was the moment that took the American people back in time. It is a moment that broke down all of the current for the time stories of "race, class, progress, competency, and humanity." The images of mass suffering of blacks while the United States government assisted white neighborhoods shattered this idea. She describes the blues as a "tradition of investigation and  interpretation" and is one of the "central institutions of African American life" and goes as far to call it an "unique intellectual movement." She continues to speak on the way the white racist structure of America has destroyed the black community and attempted to suppress it. 

##Reflection
 I really enjoyed the construction of the argument in the piece by Woods while I found myself rereading various passages from Sharpe's piece.  The integration of song lyrics in Woods' article really enhanced the narrative flow and either set up or close the different subsections.  One of the concepts I enjoyed most in the Woods piece was the idea of the "mecca and jerusalem of African Americans" and the idea of New Orleans being the "Black Vatican." For my personal experience as an African American I feel like we defintely have a defined culture but I never think about locations in the the way she explained in the paragraph.

## Comments
In response to Megan's second question regarding how MSU and LSU are able to create such high performing sports teams because children especially black students despite their primary schools funding are told to pursue sports. It makes sense that in an extremely poor states children would look for ways to escape that reality through an extracurricular that gives them something to look forward to in life. MSU and LSU do not care about how smart the students are they just want them their to play sports and make the college money.

## Questions

1. What are some African American meccas you have come across in your own hometowns?
2. Why do organizations like BLM get villainized but the White Citizen's Council can be erased and barely talked about in history books?
3. At what time did African American's start using the word woke to mean a level of consciousness of the system attempting to hold us down? Is the term now over-used and lost it's meaning?
