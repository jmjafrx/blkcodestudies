## Lab Log #2.5 | Channing Kimble-Brown

### Overview

Novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie came to Johns Hopkins as a Foreign Affairs Symposium speaker for the speaker series "Undercurrent" and as a special guest for Black History Month. She answered questions about American and Nigerian politics, writing, academia, race and gender politics, and her general pessimism about where the United States is really going from here. She was very much in favor of getting in touch with our anger at injustice and actually acting and voting to combat the complacency that a lot of Democrats that didn't vote likely felt. She worries about American complacency and our obsession with being nice and polite as we seek progress. She also felt like the idea of a global citizen wasn't nearly as important as the idea of a local one, and that diasporic movements spring from the local, meaning that we should appreciate and support people's differences and learn from that. Especially when people are so negatively marked for being from countries that are not at the center of power.

During her question and answer session she delved a bit more into Nigerian politics and her books. She talked about gender being a central issue in why she identifies as a Feminist and touched a bit on the importance of different sexual orientations being represented in fiction. There was also a moment that was very much about reconciling her identity as a Nigerian woman with American blackness.

### Reflection

The entire event was a really inspiring experience and I agreed with almost every single thing she said. I think she was right about many of Trump's supporters being economically disenfranchised and being desparate enough to accept any kind of change offered to them, seeing him as a kind of Messiah. I also agree with her assessment that there was a sort of ugly hatred and fear that drew supporters to him and made such an unqualified person seem like a valid and appealing choice. She also said that emotional pleas don't work but facts will, but I am not sure how true that is because #AlternativeFacts have become so pervasive thanks to our president and his inner circle. So many seem to be will and eager to believe him without any support or qualification and he only seemed to speak to these people using intense emotion real facts are going to get through. 

Something else that struck me was her discussion about academia and how all the research and publishing seems to have no meaningful end if it can't be used to bring about some sort of positive change in the world because the people that need the information cannot understand it. It makes sense to me but I don't know about the tenure system to make any suggestions as to how to motivate people to write for the greater good and not just for their own job security.

One of the most interesting parts to me was during the Q&A at the end where she said that blackness was something she very much had to learn. That it was very deeply rooted in African American history but was also an identity that African people could choose to be a part of. Having no first hand experience with race outside of the US, it was illuminating for me to hear that people have to learn how to interpret and interact with it as African immigrants being exposed to it for the first time and not growing up with it.

### Expand

The moderator brought up an interview linked [here](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/28/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-slams-bbc-ambush-with-trump-supporter-newsnight) where Adichie was ambushed into being on a panel with a Trump supporter that dismissed her before the cameras were even rolling and tried to explain to her what racism is. The video of the interview is difficult to watch but Adichie very clearly expresses why the campaign and Trump's election are so troubling and how the use of xenophobia and racism do not bode well for the type of president he is going to be.

### Question
0. How do Caribbean immigrants view blackness? Do their various histories with slavery mean they have similar ideas of race to African Americans or are there factors that make the concept completely different?
1. Adichie said the the Women's March happened because a lot of people were angry but I wonder if that anger will be strong enough to fight complacency. For many that was their first time marching, is there a way to harness that anger and keep the momentum going for more specific issues that aren't necessarily affecting everybody?
2. Will universities and academia ever shift towards making their vast amounts of knowledge available and accessible to the public? How would they even do that?
