##Overview

* "In the Shadow of the Castle: (Trans)Nationalism, African American Tourism, and Goree Island" by Salamishah Tillet

In this narrative Salamishah Tillet explores the creation of "African-American exceptionalism" and the oversymbolization of slavery because of the work of two photographers on Goree Island in Senegal. Tillet opens with a recounting of Bill Clinton first apologizing for slavery on his tour throughout Africa and then immediately retracting his apology for the sake of progress. Tillet goes to give a brief history of the timeline of the "Coming Home" tours, or Black Americans "returning" to Africa, and their reasons for becoming so popular. These tours gain so much attention that two photographers, Chester Higgins and Carrie Mae Weems, independently try to capture the essence of slavery by establishing the House of Slaves as the last place slaves would see and be transported through before they boarded a ship that would take them to hell. Tillet claims that Higgins's picture feigns an inaccurate sense of a trans-continental African Diaspora, while Weems's set of photos ignores the realities of present-day Senegal and exacerbates isolation. In conclusion, Tillet argues that both photographers' photos only are used as symbols of slavery and, unfortunately, nothing more. 

* "The Definitive Story of How the National Museum of African American History and Culture Came to Be" by Lonnie Bunch 

Lonnie Bunch, the head of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, reflects on his journey to curating and managing a museum that faced success just as much as it faced opposition and challenges. His first problem starts before the work can even begin, as he and his partner cannot enter their offices by using keys and resort to asking a janitor to aide them. Bunch then goes over the troubles of the actual museum and its fruition. Trailing back to the 1920s, Bunch explains that this museum has been waiting for a reveal for nearly a century. Bunch then goes to give anecdotes about his love for history and also his confusion on why certain people treated him more unfairly than they did to others. After reading about these experiences, we then get to see this decade long journey: from its 7 person staff to a worldwide competition concerning how the building would be be designed, to the enormous amount of support it recieved when in seek of volunteers, items, and stories. The amount of appreciation and gratitude that Bunch expresses while recounting the process is hard to be missed. 

* "Toward Meaning-making in the Digital Age: Black Women, Black Data and Colored Conventions" by Sarah Patterson 

This Common-Place journal entry by Sarah Patterson spends a majority of its time discussing the effects of 19th century colored conventions that took place in the northeast. Patterson establishes the concerns these delegates who were part of this convention had, but she also illuminates the fact that women were often forgotten during these conventions. Because of this erasure, Patterson began a separate online exhibit called "Colored Conventions Project", which showcases the brilliant women behind these conventions and the work that they did. In this entry, she spends a signifigant amount of time discussing Elizabeth Gloucester, a woman whose monetary involvement and activism went uncommemorated for too long. Why this financial success was important was becasue of the findings made by James Cune Smith. Census data, at the time, on black individuals was almost entirely fabricated, and colored convention needed proof that showed that the black state of living was not as dismal as the government had made it seem. Patterson further explains that this proof was vital to stopping discriminatory practices and increasing black mobility. The end of the entry shows more support for her online exhibit and seems to encourage readers to visit it.

* "The Cocreators of Underground on Bringing Slave Stories to the Small Screen" by Julia Felsenthal 

In this article featured on Vogue, Julia Felsenthal interviews Misha Geen and Joe Pokaski on their creation of the show *Underground*, based on the existence of the Underground Railroad. The article first explains that Green is black and Pokaski is white, and that both creators felt that combining their different life expereinces would best fit the show. The article goes on to give a brief synopsis of the show with character name drops. Felsenthal then explains that the show can be very "light-hearted" and goes on to ask Green and Pokaski multiple questions on how they managed to produce such a new type of slave narrative. The creators then go on to answer these question, their subjects ranging from their knowledge of the Underground Railroad before they began the show to the importance of music choice to how much research they did. 

* "Thoughts on Underground" by Noelle Trent 

Noelle Trent spends a brief amount of time relfecting on her opinion of what seems to be the first two episodes of the show *Underground*. Trent explains that she definetley was skeptical of how the show would be recieved by mainstream media before seeing an uncut screening, however she later assures readers that the complexities within this show do history justice while also being entertaining. Trent gives a short synopsis and introduces the main characters, she then goes on to praise the show for its complex depiction of white people during this time, challenging the current ideology concerning slaves, and accurately showing the multi-faceted emotions of slaves. 


##Reflection

I found the photo analysis that Tillet did and compiled on Weems and Higgins absolutely incredible. The extensive details on what was and was not present in the phots blew me away and I can't help but think about how Tillet would feel about Underground. The show is incredibly inclusive and versatile in its ability to switch from real and painful to real and heartwarming to real and comical, but would she still consider it merely a symbol of slavery as opposed to the literal representation of it? Tillet's focus on the orientation of Weems photos was something that I could not have been able to see on my own, so thinking back to the cinematography of 12 Years a Slave made me excited. Particularly the scene in which we see Solomon tip-toeing for a very uncomfortable amount of time in order to avoid choking to death after Tibeats' attempted murder. For what felt like a lifetime, the audience watches uncomfortably as Solomon is clutching on to life while other adult slaves watch and children play. During this scene, Solomon is never the only one in the frame and it is not from the same perspective for the whole time. Switching angles, providing everyday backgrounds, and keeping the camera at a distance almost the entire time, for me, now that I think back on it, produced the sense of my physical presence and I think that's what made the scene so uncomfortable. With such animated backgrounds, I no longer felt like someone who was removed and watching this movie in my room, I was there. I was just as guilty as the mistress, I was just as unbothered as the children, and I was just as detachedly concerned as the adults all at once. The feeling, in hindsight was horrifying, and I feel that Tillet would find the fact that this scene could create such a feeling proof that this movie was not just symbolic. 


##Expand

This picture found on the [online exhibit](coloredconventions.org), curated by Sarah Patterson stuck out to me just becasue I realized that nearly every black and white picture I've seen that has shown black children in it have all been when the children are slaves or they're just children who are extremely poor and are naked. I truly cannot recall having seen a picture that was vintage/old/authentic that showcased black children as kids who were dressed and proper and human.

##Questions

* If Felsenthal (Vogue) had asked questions about how Green and Pokaski's respective races affected the research process of this show, had that would've been worthwhile to read? Do you think it was something she would've been allowed to publish? Would you have asked if you were her?

* Tillet claimed that the African Diaspora was made up to be much too cohesive in Higgins's photo, what do you think the average Black American would say the diaspora? The average African? The average Afro-Caribbean?

* If the National Museum of African American History and Culture had been completed around the first time it was suggested, the 1920s, would it have been more or less controversial than the opening of the 2016 version?
