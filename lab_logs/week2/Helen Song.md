## Overview

This week we read articles regarding how the history of African Americans has been under-represented and often misconstrued, and how new projects such as TV show Underground (WGN America), Colored Conventions Project, and the new Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture are finally getting it right by accurately portraying the multi-faceted nature of African American history.

Salamishah Tillet writes in her paper about "coming home" tours for African Americans as they visit a prominent slave port, Goree Island, in Senegal, and how these tours have become so popular for Black Americans as they are in a way returning to their roots. Tillet explores how two photographers who capture these tours actually inaccurately portray both slavery and present-day Senegal, and how they ultimately fail to be more than mere symbols.

Lonnie Bunch describes his experience as the director of the new Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture, the incredible difficulty he had founding the museum, his personal story as a historian, and the importance of Black history in America. 

Sarah Patterson brings to light the "Colored Conventions Project" as a way to spotlight the African American women who were often erased and forgotten, despite their essential roles in these conventions. She also explains why it is key to accurately portray the lifestyle of African Americans.

Julia Felsenthal interviews the co-creators of *Underground* for Vogue, and they discuss how they worked to make the show as historically accurate as possible and their motives behind creating characters with agency in their own narratives (avoiding white saviorism).

Noelle Trent writes about how the show *Underground* does a very good job of bringing "modern historiography to life" by obviously having thoroughly researched slave life and exploring the lives of white people in antebellum America. She strongly encourages fellow historians to support the show as it combats false portrayals of America's brutal history.

##Reflection

History is always a conflict between what is being portrayed and what is being erased, and within an institutionally racist society and nation, African American history is constantly being sabotaged, deleted, degraded, etc. This becomes clear every February when people question the existence of a Black History Month, or when people support Mammy stereotypes or Aunt Jemima to this day. This combination of articles gave me more hope in a better portrayal of African American history, especially regarding slavery, which was so recent and still has clear and significant ramifications to this day.

I was personally very intrigued by Lonnie Bunch's article because I have read about the struggles the new Smithsonian museum had being built and being recognized as necessary.

This is a really interesting little introduction to Michael Ross' book *The Great New Orleans Kidnapping Case*, which was a case that took place right after the Civil War in the surrounding area of where Northup worked as a slave. It's really interesting for Ross to connect these three time periods in the same place: antebellum America, post-Civil War America, and today.

## Comment
I was very struck by Tejiri's reflection about what Tillet might have thought about Underground because I was personally extremely moved by the show (I ended up spending time watching more episodes, and will most likely finish soon), but I also wonder whether Tillet may have felt that this portrayal of runaway slaves as symbolic. I was fascinated by Tillet's in-depth analysis of these photographs, and I really think it would be amazing to read more of Tillet's writings on other photographs, movies, TV series, etc. 

## Question
 
- What does historical accuracy, especially African American history, mean in a day and age where there is the growing phenomenon of "alternative facts," "fake news", and just general blatant lying? How do we fight against these problems as academics, social media users, historians, and consumers?
- History is a means for the powerful to construct narratives, and the examples we read about are ways that this power is being taken back. However, how can allies (white people) also help change this power dynamic?
