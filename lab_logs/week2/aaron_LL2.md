## OVERVIEW:
### “In the Shadow of the Castle: (Trans)Nationalism, African American Tourism, and Gorée Island”
In this article, Salamishah Tillet argues that the modern “return to Africa” movement roots itself in a tourist mindset, and that the works of two specific photographers, misguides African-Americans to view Senegal and Ghana as symbols of slavery, ignoring current social and economic conditions.

### “The Definitive Story of How the National Museum of African American History and Culture Came to Be” by Lonnie Bunch
Lonnie Bunch narrates the process of creating the National Museum of African American History form inception. Themes of community building, artistic vision, and embodying history harmonize to vividly depict some of the museum’s most iconic exhibits and how they came to be.

### "Toward Meaning-making in the Digital Age: Black Women, Black Data and Colored Conventions" by Sarah Patterson
Sarah Patterson’s article, born out of the Colored Conventions Project, speaks of two often neglected topics that bear considerable weight in illuminating a historiography of antebellum black society in America. First, Patterson studies the role of women in within the milieu of Black thinkers, politicians, and activists by highlighting Elizabeth Gloucester’s social and economic value, which likely would have been leveraged in creating a prosperous view of free black society.  Second, Patterson examines the role of the national census in painting a maligned and inaccurate representation of African Americans and the dusty of the data collectors in the 1843 

## REFLECTION:
“The Cocreators of *Underground* on Bringing Slave Stories to the Small Screen” and “Thoughts on *Underground*”
These two articles touch on aspects of Underground that make it a show that, despite a few good traits, is ultimately unappealing to me. To quickly highlight the good that happens in Underground: slavery is shown as a sprawling institution with impact up North too (commendable for the small screen), characters have agency, and most characters are in a grey moral area, which serves up great material for future episodes. The major fault I find with Underground is that despite its historical accuracy, it seems to service prestige action-suspense genre tropes before telling a story about slavery. The fact that the interviewer notes that  “there was something very X-Men about the way this group of runaways joined forces,” (to me it felt like Ocean’s Eleven, down to episode 1’s title!) proves to me that the liberties taken with the source material don’t serve to enhance an understanding of slave resistance, but rather to gloss over details in order to drive a story about heroes. For all the research that was put into this show, it could’ve amounted to more than a heist movie set-up. What does interest me is the decision on behalf of the writers to begin with the Dred Scott case and set their sights on the Emancipation Proclamation; these obviously carry serious significance in the (de)codification of slavery.

## EXPAND:
In a strange way, *Underground* reminds me of the horror movie *The Witch* in its reliance on historical accounts. The Witch success because the historical accounts give a sense of realism and authenticity to ground a narrative otherwise too radical, to be believed. *Underground* unfortunately eschews the potential to tell a grounded story in exchange for barrel-chested heroes and action tropes.

## COMMENT:
To Teriji’s final question, I think the obvious answer is of course! However, I am glad that the museum opened in 2016, as we now have decades more art, community, and history to recognize and celebrate.

## QUESTION:
* In sticking with genre adaptions of antebellum America, how could a legal procedural (like Law & Order) enhance understanding of slave codes and conditions?
* Think of a potential artifact of black history, imagine its place in the National Museum African American History and Culture, and speak to its overarching meaning.
* What do you believe is the role of anachronisms in Underground? Why are they there, what purpose do they serve?
