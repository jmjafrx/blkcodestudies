### Overview: 
Vogue interviews the co-creators of the television series *Underground*, writing on how this story came to be. Along with some background on the show itself, the article discusses what was different about the *Underground* from other slave narratives on the screen. Misha and Joe talk about the fine balance between the horrifying nature of slavery and the drama prevalent in most television shows.

Noelle writes on the show itself. She goes over the main characters and complex conflicts that consist of this show's plot. She recounts the background stories for the main characters, and how those each play a role in the show's plot line. Her point about *Downtown Abbey* was very interesting. Noelle's end take is that shows like this are what's going to disperse the accurate info to the larger American public, and hopefully change the discussion about slavery.

The Smithsonian article focuses on the director of the National Museum of Africa American History and Culture. Lonnie Bunch retells his story of how the Museum came to be, summarizing every event from the idea to the opening of such an institution. The uncertainty  faced at every step, from accessing their temporary offices to hunting down artifacts to coming up with an all-encompassing narrative makes for a brilliant story about human resilience and quirkiness. 

Sarah Patterson's journal entry centers on coloured conventions that would take place in the 19th century Northeast. She takes issue with the misrepresentation of black women, as well as the black community, at such gatherings. Citing Elizabeth Gloucester as a prime example of the economic wealth and strength of black women is a part of Paterson's hope to change the narrative about black mobility and discrimination.

Salamishah Tillet in *In the Shadow of the Castle* in centered at the Goree Islands and its relevance to the African slave trade as well as the narrative of the African American diaspora as a whole. Her main point is that conversation around slavery is over stressed by leaving the rest of the parts that make up African American history and the African diaspora out of it. Tillet focuses on the work of two photographers, Chester Higgins and Carrie Mae Weems, whom she claims do not fully capture the essence of the African diaspora. To Tillet, the pictures merely portray the tale of slavery, and leave out the countless cultures and traditions embedded across the African spectrum.
### Reflection:
The *Underground* co-creators take on the slavery narrative, about how slaves on the screen are typically treated as victims, after frantically thinking back over previous movies I'd seen, made me realize how true this was. Their want to portray slaves as also revolutionaries, to me at least, is a much needed move in changing how people now perceive slaves and slavery.

Bunch's opening about how no one, not the Smithsonian, not him not the country, was prepared for the undertaking of such an idea as a National Museum of African American History and Culture sets a standard for his undertaking as well as African American history in general. America has never seemed prepared to fully accept the facts of its horrible past, but now seems to be moving in the right direction with the conversation.

What all the articles appeared to center around was the inaccurate representation of African American history, and more specifically slavery. Each reading brought up an issue, whether it be gender inequality or missing culture, that must be added to the narrative if the African American tale is to be told fully and correctly.
### Expand:
The words "Edible Exhibit" just made me really happy. I also think that it's such a cool way to acquaint people with cuisines from the African continent.

### Comment:
I have not yet visited the Baltimore Museum of Art, and found Channing's comment to send shivers up my spine. The thought of the Strange Fruit wood carving, after watching 12 Years a Slave, makes envisioning what horrors befell the victims all too easy.
### Questions:

* Is there anything that can be done in American schools to shift the slavery narrative more in the direction of what African Americans know should be the accurate depiction? Would teaching about figures such as Elizabeth Gloucester be a step in the right direction?
* Since the co-creators of *Underground* are both black and white, do their own viewpoints and experiences contrast greatly when producing the show, and are such differences visible in the episodes?
* What was the biggest effect of the 'Back to Africa' movement in America itself?
