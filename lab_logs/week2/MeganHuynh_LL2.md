# OVERVIEW:
The Tillet reading mainly focuses on how the portrayal of slavery is skewed and how the “Back to Africa” movement depicted certain aspects of slavery inaccurately. The Smithsonian article is Lonnie Bunch’s 10 year “great adventure” creating the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Vogue interviews the writers of the show about how they developed the show and what they envision it to be. In the AAIHS article summarizes the first episode and its nuances.   
# REFLECTION:
A common theme I have found in many of these readings, especially from the Vogue interview, Black Women, Black Data, and Colored Conventions readings, and the Tillet reading, is they all believe that a certain part of history has been untold or too sensitive to be told. For example, in the Black Women, Black Data, and Colored Conventions reading they discuss how “historical records ignore black women or misrepresent Black communities.” It sounds as if historians re-invent stories about what happened in order to fulfill some sort of agenda – whether it be to make people feel guilty for what happened during slavery or to downplay the accomplishments of Blacks during the period. This is evident in the Tillet reading in which certain photographs such as Higgins’ “The Door of No Return at the House of Slaves”, glorifies Africa and depicts it in memory of how they want it to be remembered – not necessarily how it was historically in order to promote the “Back to Africa” movement.

This photo of Michelle Obama is from President Barack Obama’s speech at the dedication ceremony for the National Museum of African American History and Culture in September. I think these kinds of reactions show how these buildings can be of incredible importance to Americans. The emotional reactions and positive reception of this museum, especially in a place so central at the National Mall, proves its historical and cultural significance. 
# COMMENT:
Helen Song’s post: I thought it was interesting that people praised Brad Pitt as an ally because he invested in many black artists in movie making. I definitely agree that investing money in projects made by black artists helps promote artistry, creativity, and the promotion of work made by black people. I think that a first reaction when one hears about Brad Pitt’s involvement in these movies is that he is once again playing the “white savior”. I disagree with this. He has nothing to do with saving black people, he just realizes the immense talent that has not been emphasized in a white-dominated industry. 
# QUESTION:
1.	Many of our readings talk about how the perception of slavery and African-Americans during that time are misconstrued. Where and how can we find out the “true” history and story of slavery that satisfies all the authors who say we over glorify certain aspects of the “historic imagining of Africa.”
2.	Did these national conventions help blacks attend? Did they provide accommodations for housing, transportation, and food? If not, what was the method that most people used to be able to attend such conventions? For example, during the Jim Crow Era many people use the Green Book to navigate where blacks could eat and sleep.
3.	Why do we celebrate Brad Pitt more than Elizabeth Gloucester? Gloucester paved her way to success by investing in real estate, supporting the black community, and creating social value. Both contributed to black causes financially, yet Brad Pitt gets more recognition. Is it because a white man backing up black artists is more credible? Memorable? Honorable?
