### Overview

Tillet, Salamishah. “In the Shadow of the Castle: (Trans)Nationalism, African American Tourism, and Gorée Island.” 

- Tillet, in the essay “In the Shadow of the Castle: (Trans)Nationalism, African American Tourism, and Gorée Island”, discusses inconsistencies between “Back to Africa” discourses of the 19th and 20th centuries, benefits to African-American heritage tourism. She extensively analyzes one image by Chester Higgins, “The House of Slaves at the Door of No Return”, highlighting the sharp contrast of black to white in the image, suggesting her identity as a member of the “black world”, even though “her nonspecificity claims nowhere” (131). 

Bunch, Lonnie. “The Definitive Story of How the National Museum of African American History and Culture Came to Be.” 

- Lonnie Bunch’s article in the Smithsonian Magazine briefly describes various stages of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture’s creation: an 11 year process. Bunch and other staff members spent years searching everywhere for artifacts, from the home of a woman in Chicago, to Mozambique. With the selection of artifacts, he sought humanize experience and struggles of African Americans and to tell these stories as a part of a complex national and global narrative. 

Patterson, Sarah. “Toward Meaning-Making in the Digital Age: Black Women, Black Data and Colored Conventions.” 

- Patterson’s 2015 article addresses the historical exclusion of Black women even in early Black delegations and conventions, socio-economic status of Black women, “intellectual cultures” in the black community, and benefits of open-source digital media. Using the example of the online exhibit, “Black Wealth and the 1843 National Colored Convention”, Patterson suggest that digital media has allowed Black women to differentiate themselves from the traditional patriarchal narratives that often omitted their struggles and illuminate their status as entrepreneurs and leaders. Her mention of incorrect census labeling Black communities as “disproportionately insane, impoverished, rapidly decreasing, and thus degenerate” data inhibited Black economic freedom and misrepresented the impact individuals and societies had on their respective communities. 

Felsenthal, Julia. “The Cocreators of Underground on Bringing Slave Stories to the Small Screen.” 

- This article by Julia Felsenthal contains a transcript of her interview with Misha Green and Joe Pokaski, co-creators of Underground. Throughout the interview, Green and Pokaski discuss difficulties that arise in writing a drama while representing the brutal history as accurately as possible and the public’s fear of “the harshness of the times”. The depiction of many African-American characters as revolutionaries in the show, rather than victims, and the superhero tropes that define them attempt to eliminate this fear and change the traditional African-American narrative of the 1800s. 

“Thoughts on Underground – AAIHS.” 

- In this article, Noelle Trent, employee at the National Civil Rights Museum, provides a brief summary of episodes one and two of Underground. She notes that the show explores the complex lives of antebellum whites, and does well in “[presenting] slaves as human beings rather than caricatures in need of a white savior.” She finally calls for historians like herself to support shows like Underground and combat the inaccurate representations of African-American slaves we see today.

### Reflection
	
I have never considered questioning the way I have been taught about slavery. Having read these articles, especially Felsenthal’s in Vogue, I am beginning to recognize many patterns in my education of the subject. The most striking are the virtual deification of Abraham Lincoln and other white leaders as the sole saviors of African-American “victims” and the paucity of information related to the rich and complex African Histories. 

Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was revolutionary and of critical importance in terms of African-American freedom. However, describing his actions as the only reason slavery ended disregards the resilience and integrity of many African-Americans who refused to helplessly wait to be freed. African-Americans who escaped and advocated for true universal freedom were not just victims of an oppressive system but the nation’s revolutionaries. It is disappointing that they are rarely ever recognized as such. 

Secondly, there was rarely any focus on African history. The way I was taught, slaves immediately obtained a new identity after setting foot on American soil, and their AFrican Heritage was forgotten. Just because the oppressive system disregarded the culture and origin of these millions of people, does not mean we should do the same. There is more to slavery than a greedy white man and a cotton field. African politics, societies and origins have been forgotten in the traditional American retelling of the era. Institutions like the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture are critical in regards to recognizing and remembering where slaves came from, the lives they left behind and understanding the complex slave narrative.

### Expand

I visited to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture website to see what type of artifacts Bunch and his team acquired. One image in particular that caught my eyes was the [“Deed of sale including 237 enslaved persons in transaction”](https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2010.1.317a-g?destination=explore/collection/search%3Fedan_fq%5B0%5D%3Dset_name%253A%2522Slavery%2520and%2520Freedom%2520Objects%2522%26edan_local%3D1). It is striking how the emotional distress individuals experience upon being sold (take Eliza from 12 Years a Slave) was reduced rather casually to a “successful business deal”.

### Comment
I thought the article Channing posted about the Sweet Home Cafe was very interesting. Legacies of slavery are often only explored in a few dimensions, such socio-economic status or political power. The cultural legacies, be it song, or in this case food are often forgotten. I especially liked this quote from Jerome Grant: “African-American cooking techniques, to me, are American techniques.” Recognizing African-American history and cultures in this way can help re-write the skewed narrative.

### Questions

- How can educators change the way slavery in the United States is taught to create a more comprehensive understanding of African-American history? 
- Many articles for this week stress the importance digital (and physical) artifacts in telling the story of the Black experience in America. Could social media sites be an effective means of spreading this narrative? 
- Are historical dramas and movies like Underground and 12 Years A Slave, in spite of potential historical falsehoods, the best and or easiest way to inform the public about African-Americans in the United States, or are more traditional means (databases and museums)?
