# Overview: 

### Tillet

Salamishah Tillet discusses a transformation in the “Back to Africa” movement after Civil Rights. Previously, Americans of African descent sought a sort of homecoming where the stench of slavery and its legacy would no longer taint their existence. Tillet argues that the Civil Rights movement altered this perspective. Now, African Americans go “Back to Africa” to see the origins of slavery as though it is all one monument to their ancestors suffering. To this effect, tourists have swarmed and shone a light on documentation of the physical structures that the transatlantic slave trade built. For example, the “Door of No Return” has inspired two famous photographs by Chester Higgins and Carrie Mae Weems that Tillet dissects at great length. In conclusion, Tillet uses these photographs to illustrate her belief that the condition of African Americans in America has unfortunately isolated them their history. 

### Smithsonian

This article follows the director of the Smithsonian Museum of African American History, Lonnie Bunch, in her years-long journey to build a new collection, space, and legitimacy for the complicated history of African Americans. Specifically, the article is about the difficulties and triumphs experienced by Bunch and her team over the course of the Museum’s gestation. Beginning with a few anecdotes about our government’s halfhearted and underfunded efforts to accomplish this goal earlier, Lonnie delves into the resistance and competing objectives she faced deciding how to treat the subject of slavery. She also gives details about the museum’s location and architecture that show the thought and detail that went into this monumental accomplishment.

### Common Place

In this article, Sarah Patterson discusses efforts to supplement skewed Federal Census data on African American contributions to society and economic standing. Apparently, the census data was deliberately falsified to support policy decisions that further disenfranchised African Americans and reinforced negative stereotypes. Planners of the Colored Conventions sought to correct these wrongs by leading black data collection efforts. Patterson also describes the charitable and entrepreneurial spirit of Elizabeth Gloucester, a member of the black Brooklyn intelligentsia. Gloucester is used to highlight the successes and contributions of Black women in American’s development and community organization.

### Vogue

This is an interview with the writers of Underground, Misha Green and Joe Pokaski. The interview addresses the white and black writer’s perspectives on the Underground Railroad and its underrepresentation in popular historical entertainment. It also introduces a “superhero” interpretation to the team of runaway slaves, each of whom has a specific power. The writers also reveal that they conducted rigorous research to weave together true anecdotes to form a fictional yet historically accurate TV show.

### Black Perspectives

This is a reflection by Nation Civil Rights Museum employee Noelle Trent on her first viewing of Underground. She says she appreciates the show’s accurate portray of pre-Antebellum slave life. Trent is especially satisfied by the show’s deep characters, each of whom has motivations for leaving the plantation and, as a result, independent agency. A historian herself, Trent also likes that Underground is grounded in factual reality. 

# Reflection:

I am personally exhausted by Tillet’s analysis of the two photographs. Both images were beautiful pieces of art but cannot, I think, be contrived to represent 10 page’s worth of slavery symbolism. I applaud Tillet’s zeal for the project and for attempting to elucidate the evolution of the Back to Africa movement, but I think this point was best proved when she discussed the “paradox of racial politics in the post-Civil Rights US.” I think the superhero trope discussed in the Vogue interview is a fascinating way of empowering the black characters in a drama that literally exhibits black enslavement. I look forward to watching the rest of this series to see if and how the story continues to follow that narrative. 

# Expand:

Check out the similarities between Kayne’s music video [Kanye's music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q604eed4ad0) for Black Skinhead and the opening scene of Underground. In both, you can barely discern the subject’s face, the hues of the video are black and white, and the imagery is highly stylized.

# Comment:

I noticed that Tejiri enjoyed Tillet’s analysis of the images. In her reflection, Tejiri said how she feels like Tillet’s discussion gave new context to the almost-lynching scene from 12 Years a Slave. I think that this scene is far more purposefully crafted to symbolize black suffering than the images presented in Tillet’s analysis. This is because the director had full creative control over everything in the film scene, whereas the photographer is simply capturing a reality that they cannot edit.

# Question:

1. How do you feel about the Smithsonian director’s choices for the museum? Should the museum have portrayed African American victimhood as a Holocaust story?

2. What do you think were the formalized processes for black data suppression before the civil rights movement?

3. Does modern music ever work in period films or does it commercialize and overpower the moments it is meant to amplify?
