# Overview
* "In The Shadow of the Castle: :Trans" Nationalism, African-American Tourism and Goree Island" 
Salamishah Tillet discusses the distinct difference in discourse between earlier understandings of "Back to Africa" to contemporary understandings. Tillet argues that earlier discourse focused on the emancipatory aspect of "Back to Africa" as a way for slaves to escape plantation life, however current understandings of "Back to Africa" is closely associated with expatriate movements. Tillet argues that this shift in discourse changes the views around slavery; instead of using the narrative of slavery to focus on concrete solutions that could create a sustainable living spaces in Africa, the narrative of slavery is more of remembrance.

* "The Cocreators of Underground on Bringing Slave Stories to the Small Screen" by Julia Felsenthal 
Julia Felsenthal interviews the cocreators of Undergrond, Misha Geen and Joe Pokaski. The content of the interview focuses on the creators background, and motive to create a show focusing on the Underground Rail Road. Both Geen and Pokaski emphasize the need to tell stories from the past to celebrate the bravery of men and women who fought for their freedom

* "Thoughts on Underground" by Noelle Trent
Noelle Trent praises Underground on telling a story about slavery that does not rely on pure spectacle, instead focuses on the daily lives of slaves relating to interpersonal relationships and personal struggles. Trent argues this is a creative way to create a period piece on slavery without relying on it solely being about slavery and its brutal conditions. 

# Reflection
* In "The Co-creators of Underground on Brining Slave Stories to the Small Screen" co-creator Joe Pokaski states that he found it fascinating that individuals who fought for their freedom rarely spoke about their heroism in the fear of being prosecuted. I found this statement really interesting because it spoke to the importance of context. In the status quo, we use social media platforms to share the bravery and courage of historical figures in creating meaningful change and sometimes are frustrated that studying history is often problematic because of the limited view it provides us about nonwhite individuals. However, we rarely think about why we do not hear about these stories. Reading Pokaski's statement made me realize that one reason we do not hear more stories of bravery is because it was traumatic for those individuals who actually committed those acts of bravery. This made me also think about Underground and theme of the "unsung hero". In the show, everyone is convinced that Moses is literate, when in reality Pearly, his wife, is the only one who can read and write. Instead of bragging or sharing her ability with others, Pearly tries to hide in the background. I think part of the reason she hides is because she is afraid of  she would be considered a threat to the social order of the plantation.

While I was reading Patterson's article on the importance of data, I could not help but relate it to the buzz of Hidden Figure. I agree with Patterson on the necessity of a repository because I think data is quite powerful in creating a narrative that inspires individuals to believe in themselves. For instance, while the data on the work of black women in the colored convention from antebellum north seems trivial, the data shows how black women were socially active and had agency within their community. This is a powerful narrative that allows individuals to realize the important and positive role they played. 

# Comment
	To answer tejirismith_LL2.md first question about the co-creators race, I think it would have interesting to hear how their own race has influenced certain scenes in the tv-show. I think that would add a new layer into the show as it would provide a 21st century perspective on slavery while maintaining their storyline. I think the author of the article should be allowed to ask questions about their race/publish it as that already seems to be embedded in the discussion.

# Questions 
1. How can data be presented in a socially relevant manner? 
2. What implication do the shift in "Back to Africa" discourse have on the understanding of slavery?
3. In the future, what methods can directors, producers, and writes employ to present stories about slavery that do not solely focus on its conditions?
