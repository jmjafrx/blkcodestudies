## **Lab Log #2 | Channing Kimble-Brown**

### Overview

“In the Shadow of the Castle: (Trans)Nationalism, African American Tourism, and Gorée Island.” 
* In this paper Salamishah Tillet explores African American attempts at connecting everyone in the African disapora to a common trans-nationalist African identity through African American tourism. She focuses on two people that tried to express this desire through photography of ports turned tourist attractions where slaves were sent off to the New World, never to see African soil again. She describes Charles Wiggins' work as erasing boundaries and removing any national identity from members of the diaspora while she describes Carrie Mae Weems as celebrating it. Both photographers used photography of sites like Ile de Goree and the House of Slaves to tell the story of African diasporic people coming full circle, leaving from these ports as slaves and their descedents return free but disconnected from the land.

"The Definitive Story of How the National Museum of African American History and Culture Came to Be"
* In this article Lonnie Bunch tells the story of how he became the director of the new African American Smithsonian museum and the long journey to making the museum a reality. Bunch describes his first day, the process of raising over half a billion dollars, acquiring relevant artifacts, determining the museum's ideal balance between somber and celebratory tones, and finding an architect to design the building itself. Given all of the false starts and delays in even starting the museum, Bunch expresses his love for the museum and how strongly he believes in its necessity and impact. 

“Toward Meaning-Making in the Digital Age: Black Women, Black Data and Colored Conventions.” 
* This article by Sarah Patterson discusses historical efforts by black people to collect data on black people in America for their own use and to combat the skewed and blatantly incorrect data collected by the Federal Census, which had been used to further oppress black people and hinder their upward mobility. She relays various discussions amongst the black intelligentsia during Colored Conventions and highlights the contributions of Elizabeth Gloucester to show how important women were to the movement even if they weren't as well documented as they should have been.

“The Cocreators of Underground on Bringing Slave Stories to the Small Screen.”
* This article from Vogue interviews the cocreators of Underground, Misha Green and Joe Pokaski. Throughout the interview they discuss their enthusiasm at tackling such an interesting and important history and bringing their personal experiences with writing superheroes in the context of American slavery and the Underground Railroad. They want to explore the reasons that some slaves wanted to stay and what motivated them to escape when the risk was so high. Their primary goal is to show that black and white people alike were living full lives in 1857. 

“Thoughts on Underground – AAIHS.”
* This article from Black Perspectives was written by Noelle Trent and details her reaction to the pilot of Underground. She is an employee of the National Civil Rights Museum and applauds the show's ability to explore complex black and white characters of various backgrounds and she appreciates each character being three dimensional while remaining as true as possible to the history it's based on.

### Reflection

The paper on the African American tourism is really interesting to me because I've always wondered whether or not it would make a difference in my life to know where my ancestors actually came from on the African continent. My parents got a DNA test a few months ago and it basically told us what we expected, that both my parents had a mix of DNA from all over Western and Southern Africa. It was kind of disappointing but at the same time even if the test could pinpoint one specific area that I originated from, I wasn't raised aware or connected to anywhere other than the U.S. I very much related to what Tillet said about the photos being described with liminality and feeling like African Americans are neither here nor there. We want to feel a strong connection to more than the slavery and oppression that marked the beginning of our time in America but we can't haphazardly lump all people of African descent together either, there's just too many different experiences for that to make any sense. I do think this connects to the creation of the African American History Museum in D.C. This museum is able to give the proper weight to all of our achievements and celebrate the culture that we created while acknowledging the many ways that we've been wronged and continue to be wronged as a people. If I had to say there was a theme in the reading, they all seem to suggest that we don't need to look further than our own national history to remember that we have always been real people with lives worth talking about before, during and after slavery.

### Expand

This interview _[here](http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2017/02/06/jerome-grant-museum-african-american-history)_ is interesting to me because in addition to all of the aspects of African American culture that Lonnie Bunch mentions in his article, the executive chef, Jerome Grant, has his own way of telling the African American story through food in the Sweet Home Cafe. He pulls food from pre-slavery, post-slavery, the north and the south to celebrate African American cuisine and make it really feel like home.

### Comment

In Teijiri's reflection she really put words to a lot of what I was feeling watching the same scene in 12 Years a Slave. It also brought me back to a very recent memory of going this past weekend to see the "Strange Fruit" figure by Alison Saar in the Baltimore Museum of Art behind Shriver, which looks like this: 

![Strange Fruit](http://blog.artbma.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1995.122.jpeg)

This is a seven foot or so wooden carving covered in various metals hanging on rope from a really high ceiling. It's inspired by the anti-lynching song "Strange Fruit". Much like the scene in 12 Years a Slave I am unable to do anything but stand by and watch from various angles as someone suffers, feeling just as guilty as the people that hung the victim in the first place and it is very discomforting, especially with other people going about their business as if a hate crime isn't happening right in front of us. It's an intense experience.

### Question
0. In the interview with the creators of Underground the interviewer mentioned in passing that they can't imagine a show being made about the Holocaust in this way. I wonder, are there any other horrific historical events that can be respectfully and successfully be adapted to a TV show like Underground? Is it just about the people writing the stories being from the historically oppressed groups or are there certain stories that just shouldn't be adapted for entertainment? 
0. How do the people in these countries really feel about this African American tourism? Do they see it as good for the local economy or an invasion of space?
0. Do you think the African American Museum will inspire similar museums in other parts of the world like the Afro-Ecuadorian man was hoping?
