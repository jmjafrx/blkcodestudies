#Lab Logs

##Rules

1. Lab Logs are due on Tuesday and Thursday by 12 noon. They should be posted on git in the folder for the week under discussion. 

2. Logs must be written in Markdown (see resources.md for more on Markdown)

3. Logs should demonstrate a substantive and critical analysis of the pieces to be discussed. In a minimum of 500 words, a standard weekly lab log should do the following:

###OVERVIEW: 

Summarize the article or book chapters assigned that week
 
###REFLECTION: 

Relate the article or book chapter to our discussions of race, people of African descent, and national diversity and change in the U.S.
 
###EXPAND: 

Share something found elsewhere. Any media is acceptable: text, photo, quote, link, chat, audio, video. Be creative. Explore what has already been logged--please avoid repeats although you are welcome to reblog if you have a compelling (and substantive) comment to add.
                                   
###COMMENT: 

Comment on a log made by another student. If you are the first one posting, then comment on a log from the week before and relate it to the current week.
 
###QUESTION: 

Ask 3-5 questions of the readings and provide those in bullet points at the end of your log
 
To receive credit, your logs must demonstrate you have completed the reading; providing detailed information (names, events, time/place, sources used) will help this along. You are encouraged to reference your classmates logs. For example, a log might read, “[Peer’s Name] writes xyz but I disagree. Instead, we can think of the article/project/book for this week in terms of abc….”
  
At times, you will be asked to address specific topics or questions in your weekly log. These prompts will be distributed before the day they are due. Address these prompts as they come and incorporate into the standard format above.
