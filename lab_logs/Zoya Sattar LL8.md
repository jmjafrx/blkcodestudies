### Overview
* Simone Browne, “Everybody’s Got a Little Light Under the Sun.”
Browne starts off this week's readings on Black Surveillance through her analysis of the *Book of Negros*. She calls this book out as a surveillance tracking system used by the government to follow newly freed blacks. Highlighting several key events and figures in this time period, the Book is the one of the earliest proofs of government use of coloured bodies as tracking devices.

* Joseph, George. “U.S. Police Cellphone Surveillance by ‘Stingray,’ Mapped - CityLab.”
This article focused on the racial disparities in police use of 'Stingray' disappearance. What Stingray does is gather cellphone data from unsuspecting civilians. What Joseph reports is that this data collection is disproportionately concentrated in poor black neighborhoods around the country, from Baltimore to Tallahassee to Milwaukee. Pulling from what data was available, CityLab constructed maps visualizing this racist surveillance system. 

* Jules, Bergis. “Surveillance and Social Media Archiving.”
Addressing the serious concerns with building a social media data collection, Jules attempts to highlight how the Project *Documenting the Now* could be used by those in power to increase discriminatory and racist practices already prevalent in this country. Jules works to emphasize the importance of ensuring data collected for *DocNow* is not abused or handed to unsavory groups that would use it to suppress vocal minority leaders online and in real life. 

* Harry, Sydette. “Everyone Watches, Nobody Sees: How Black Women Disrupt Surveillance Theory.”
Harry defines surveillance as "a presumption of entitlement to access, by right or by force"- a very apt and eloquent definition. Moving on, Harry talks about the unwanted surveillance of black women throughout history, as well as the appropriation of black culture, as well as continuous erasure of black women from feminism.
### Reflection
I recall hearing about the Geofeedia company sending data of protesters to police in volatile areas back in 2015. To read Jules' article and see it layed out how expansive and terrifying it could be for law enforcement to get their hands on *DocNow* information was sobering.

'Why must black death be broadcast and consumed to be believe, and what is it beyond spectacle if it cannot be used to obtain justice?' from Harry's piece is something I was plastered on walls and tshirts. This is something people need to discuss and understand. 

Overall, the four readings dealth with the issues of surverillance disproportinatl affecting black communities and how law enforcement could use this to suffocate any movements against the status quo- very 1984-esque.

To relate this week's topic to my own experiences, I want to bring this aclu fact sheet. For doing nothing more than practicing their religion, Muslims from minority groups are now targeted and surveilled in much of the same way as black communities historically have been. 
### Comment
JB's first question I think raised some very important points on the patriarchal and misogynistic society we sadly live in. Addressing the question and finding ways to have black men start standing with black women is a necessity.
### Questions
* Has JLo ever claimed credit for the booty movement?
* Is there any way to ban the police from using Stingray? Such as taking them to court?
* Is the use of the word ethical on DocNow's website related to stopping police officers from accessing any information?
