# Overview: 

### Krauthamer and Willis, Envisioning Emancipation

This article discusses the recording of black life in photography. Mid 19th century photography was employed to defend the slave thesis by portraying pseudoscientific depictions that blacks were subhuman. Other genres of slave photography perpetuated the mammy figure and presented slavery as a benign institution that helps raise white children. However, photography was also used by free blacks and abolitionists to portray black people as equals and worthy of dignity and fair treatment. Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth were noted proponents of photography and recognized its power to persuade.

### Jones, Kellie, "To/From Los Angeles with Betye Saar.”

The article begins with a discussion of how Betye Saar’s art “drained the negative magic” of black stereotypes in art. The article portrays Saar as a cutting-edge mind in a number of ways: through her understanding of gender as performance and other feminist ideas, through mixed media and found objects, and through complex race discussion in her art. Saar’s adventurous aesthetic also influence a number of other black artists in California.

### “The Lenny Interview: Kimberly Drew, Aka @MuseumMammy.” Lenny Letter

This is an interview with a black-art social media maven who is on pace to “restructure the whiteness inherent to the contemporary-art canon.” The interview address how the internet is structured around Western language, whiteness, and the assimilation of nonconforming peoples. Drew describes blackness as a technology, an adaptation to a subjugating system. Drew found herself drawn to the internet, especially tumblr, because it facilitates a call-and-response conversation with others who are similarly interested in black contemporary art.

### Jepchumba Fakugesi, "Digital Art Residency"

This is podcast that interviews African artists. The interviewee is Jepchumba, a Kenyan artist whose art frequently melds futurism, digital media, and special effects work. The conversation revolves specifically around digital futurism, stereotypical imaginations of the future, and living in the moment. There is discussion around Africa as some sort of branded last frontier of civilization that will skip generations of innovation to lead our human future. Jupchumba also reviews her “Future Selfie Booth” installation.

# Reflect:

I found the article on photography very interesting. Photography is a medium that is often presented as fact, so to read and view images that exhibit “alternative facts” (sorry for the anachronism). I’ve never heard or thought of blackness as a technology, but the analogy makes sense. Drew’s interviewer calls certain facets of black culture “provocative,” yet still technology. I agree with this sentiment, because I think the word provocative refers to anything outside of a norm. In the internet’s case, that norm is white. I also looked through her instagram and it’s definitely work a follow. I’ve heard of Betye Saar but never looked deeply into her work. It’s fascinating and quite powerful in that it forces the viewer to come to an understanding of the intention, however wrong.

# Comment:

JB asked about the permanence of Kara Walker’s Subtlety. I think it will be regarded for decades as an extremely important example of installation art. The fact that it was ephemeral makes it all the more powerful in retrospect.

# Question:
1. What are the best forums for black art?
2. When should black art address blackness vis-a-vis whiteness, and when should it not?
3. Is photography always interpreted as factual?
