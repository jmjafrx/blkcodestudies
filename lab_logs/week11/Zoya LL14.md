### Overview
* Krauthamer and Willis, Envisioning Emancipation

*Envisioning Emancipation* is a collection of images that covers the various sides to the debate over enslavement and emancipation. These photographs spanning from the 1850s through the 1930s are a testament to their subjects' enduring legacies. This project looks at the photographic representations of slavery and freedom, and their functions as historical artifacts.  
* Jones, Kellie, "To/From Los Angeles with Betye Saar." 

This book excerpt discusses Betye Saar's beginnings as an artist. One specific work of her's, *The Liberation of Aunt Jemima*, transformed the stereotypical African mammy image into that of a fierce warrior. This flamboyant transformation of black stereotypes is linked to the explosive rise in the black arts movement. This movement took back their African heritage that had been twisted and distorted into something wrong and unrecognizable, and altered them into a black power symbols. Betye Saar aided in transforming the landscape of late twentieth century American art. 
* “The Lenny Interview: Kimberly Drew, Aka @MuseumMammy.” 

This interview with Kimberly Drew, the online community producer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is an exciting piece on how black individuals are working on overturning the Eurocentric historical narrative. Kimberley runs the Black Contemporary Art Tumblr, which is one of the most comprehensive collections of black art online, as well as the @MuseumMammy Twitter. Drew's forward-thinking Internet projects are on pace to restructure the whiteness inherent to the contemporary-art canon.
* Jepchumba Fakugesi, "Digital Art Residency," 

This audio file is by Jepchumba Fakugesi, an African digital artist. In this podcast she speaks to residency curator Tegan Bristow about her work and experiences on the residency.
### Reflection
I loved when in Kimberly Drew's interview, they call out the Internet for being made for English-speaking white people. Her point about the ñ is very valid, and something I hadn't considered before. Oh the roast contained in 'Mark Zuckerberg wants everyone in the universe to have Internet, but the Internet's not for them'. 

Envisioning Emancipations photo collection was stunning. They were an eye-opening array of pieces that showcased so many facets of life in the slavery era.

An interesting read by a right wing website. 
### Comment
To answer Jack's first question, I believe Twitter has been one of the best forums for distributing modern black art. In addition, I think Tumblr has also helped immensely by allowing black creativity to flourish on a primarily image driven platform. 
### Questions
* Why were we not shown more photos in *Escaping Emancipation* in our history books?
* Where would we be able to find exhibition with Betya Saar's work?
* Was anyone else surprised at the fact that only a third of the MET's Facebook likes are from the US? Was it shocking to realize how large of an international following this museum has?
