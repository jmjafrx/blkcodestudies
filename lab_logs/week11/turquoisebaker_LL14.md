#### Overview

Krauthamer and Willis, Envisioning Emancipation

- Envisioning Emancipation is about the use of photography to document and exploit slavery and the black experience as early as 1850. Krauthamer and Willis include many photographs, including those directed by Swiss born Harvard faculty zoologist Louis Agassiz. Agassiz’s photographs of slaves were categorized by “each daguerreotype”, treated as “a person and a specimen”. Women (and men) were stripped of their shirts and photograph, told to “stare off into the distance rather than directly at the camera, [while] contemplating serious or pleasurable thoughts”.

- While some slaves were photographed as specimens, others were included in photos to depict wealth and status, especially if included in a white family photo. Some images were used in “runaway posters”. Some black leaders and activists like Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass posed for their own photos, seeking to change the way blacks were depicted (as specimens, possessions, sexual beings, and in the context of the civil war “contraband”). 

Jones, Kellie, "To/From Los Angeles with Betye Saar." Extending the Frozen Moment 2006

- The article begins with a brief analysis of a selection of works by Betye Saar, often comprising of centuries old African American stereotypes infused with a striking realities of late 20th century racism. The black arts movement was (and is) infamous for depictions of the American climate for blacks in America, from its brutality to its beauty.

- Jones was inspired to focus on the southern California black arts movement. Artists in the 1950s like Curtis Tann and Betye Brown (Saar) introduced new ways to make art one’s trade. For Saar, it was printmaking or people and symbols in multi paned windows resembling a “film storyboard”. One of her pieces, Self-Window with Reflection (1970), speaks to an emerging feminist narrative threaded with a racial dimension. Saar’s revolutionary work inspired a new art movement that explores blackness, black beauty, spirituality and more, even today. 

“The Lenny Interview: Kimberly Drew, Aka @MuseumMammy.” Lenny Letter, November 27, 2015.

- This is the transcript of an interview between 25-year-old Instagram Star Kimberly Drew and Doreen St. Félix, editor of Lenny. Drew’s digital art compilations, @MuseumMammy (Instagram) and Black Contemporary Art (Tumblr), are dynamic, “meticulous” and “comprehensive” collections of black art. Initially, Drew states, she did not realize how “overwhelming white art history was, because [she] never equated art with whiteness”. However, her archives of black art make black art more visible to those who were “alienated from that world”. Realizing how much art people of color have created, and how much had been hidden inspired her to educate herself on the often hidden art. He wants to incite conversations amongst her large and widely international audience, especially about the art of black technologists.  

Jepchumba Fakugesi, "Digital Art Residency," Future Lab Africa Podcast, 2015 

- This was an interview with Jepchumba Fakugesi, who created a “Future Selfie Booth”. She would ask, “Do you want to go travel through time?” The user, if they answered yes, would enter her “unsophisticated time machine”, choose how far in time he or she would like to go, and leave a message as their future self for their present self. 

- “Jep” noticed that people don’t look very far into the future, often deterred by depressing undertones. She wonders why future thinking, especially in South Africa, is seen as something so inevitably dark. It is not a “utopic” concept, as Europeans in the Enlightenment believed it to be. Fakugesi finds that looking at the future from a personal, rather than “architectural” perspective makes it easier to understand in a present day context, and can help us appreciate the future as something with potential and beauty.

- Fakugesi contemplated other themes, including time in African Mythology and the nonlinear (arguably circular) nature of time. She also addressed her residency experience. She intends to continue this project, and to release the admissions to the Future Selfie Booth gradually overtime, combatting the way art and installations like her own are tethered to the “now” and time as finite. 

#### Reflection

- The portion of Envisioning Emancipation about the inclusion of slaves in white family portraiture reminds me of the way blacks are often used in a similar way in photography today: not as individuals or people, but as place holders, and representation of a corporation’s (or even a school’s) status. This status is one that many organizations are desperate to display: a status of being “diverse”. I think it is important to realize that blacks, and other marginalized groups, be they transgender people, gay men, Middle Eastern hijab-wearing women, lesbian women, and more, are often not appreciated for their substance but the additional statistic their difference provides.  

#### Expand

- (Maybe this is a bit of a stretch), but I recently saw the movie “Get Out”, which was phenomenal. This week’s readings, especially Envisioning Emancipation, reminded me of one scene in particular where a white woman was showcasing (the body) Andre Hayworth, a black man, to her other elderly white friends. Although Andre was not completely “himself” (trying to avoid major spoilers), this scene reminded me of the way Europeans have historically sought to “civilize” black in the past, and the misplaced pride they may have felt for “successfully doing so”. 

#### Comment

- In response to [Channing’s second question](https://github.com/blackcodestudies/blkcodestudies/blob/master/lab_logs/week10/channingkimblebrown_lablog13.md) I think researchers in other fields face the same difficulties of finding properly cited images, but not to the extent of historical researchers of black history. I feel like most of what we know about Black history (at least in America) could be understood as from secondary sources: white people. Photographs and illustrations of Black people or primarily Black events have historically been by white men who exaggerate or wrongly communication situations to get more money for conquest or to exploit and degrade. Visual historical accounts were used as a means of violence, and I think that is what primarily differentiates the struggle of black researchers and other historical researchers. 

#### Question

- How have your understandings or expectations of the future changed over the years? Do you find it harder or easier to predict where you will be in years to come than you did when you were younger?

- Drew mention the Blackbird in her interview. Is the internet as we know it unable to decode the black experience as Twitter, until recently, was unable to identify “ñ”? Do you think we need platforms like these?

- Years from now, how will mainstream images of black people be understood and interpreted?
