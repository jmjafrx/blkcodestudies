## Overview
### Kellie Jones
Jones discusses the African American artist Betye Saar and how her art transformed and reclaimed African American stereotypes by directly confronting them. One of her most famous works, The Liberation of Aunt Jemina, used the stereotypical figure of a nurturing Black woman to transform the image into a Black power figure. The Black arts movement reflected the situation of the time where in Los Angeles, thousands of individuals were arrested and hundreds killed and injured, where militarized police turned the streets into a war zone. 
### Krauthamer and Willis Emancipation
This piece describes how photography influenced the slave narrative and portrayed Blackness on both the side of slave owners and supporters, and from abolitionists and escaped slaves. Photography was, and still is, used to portray Black individuals as lesser and influenced stereotypes that have long been held about Black men and women, such as the Mammy figure or the dangerous man figure. Abolitionists used photography to portray slaves and Black individuals as just as human as their white counterparts.
### Lenny Letter
This is an interview with 25 year old Kimberly Drew, who is the online community producer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Her job is to dismantle the art world's barriers and create a new landscape that is not centered around whiteness. She explains how the internet was created for English speaking white people and that all of art history is white. She wants to change that dynamic and ensure that internet art is not dominated by whiteness and is created in a space inclusive of Blackness and Black art history.
### Jepchumba Fakugesi
This is a podcast of an interview between Jepchumba, an African digital artist, and Tegan Bristow, a residency curator. Jepchumba talks about her work on digital futurism and specifically, her selfie time machine installation. In this project, she asked passerbys in Johannesburg, South Africa to envision where they see themsevles in 50-100 years and to take a selfie and decide when in the future they would like to receive this. She does this to provoke futurist thought instead of focusing on a history that is predominantly a white history. 
## Reflect
I thought that Krauthamer and Willis's piece on envisioning emancipation was very thought provoking because photography is often thought of as factual. This article tackles the narrative that photography is a depicition of the truth and introduces it as a way to portray what wants to be portrayed. This article relates to Blackness and Black code because it shows how Blackness is coded and decoded through photography from different lenses.

## Comment
In response to Channing, I would send myself a message of how I imagine the world will be like at that time. It would be interesting to see how my vision differed from reality.
## Question
* How does photography morph facts in present day?
* Does having people think more about the future aid in the erasure of history? Do you think that this could be a dangerous method?
* If you were in Kimberly Drew's shoes, how would you break down barriers of the whiteness in art history?
