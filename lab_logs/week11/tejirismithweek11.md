* Krauthamer and Willis, Envisioning Emancipation

This book reflects on the telling histories of photography and black people - enslaved or free. It begins with a rundown of photography in the light of slavery, and how photos were used to directly dehumanize and degrade slaves. The authors disucss two women, Delia and Drana, were photographed and then used to justify the scientific "racial hiearchy" that white people insisted was true. The book talks about how their direct gaze into the camera in of itself is an act that lowers these two women, because of the fact that in most photos white people would try to appear in deep thought by looking away. The next section recounts the period of time where slavery was beginning to come to a close in the United States. Freed black people, like Soujourner Truth and Fredrick Douglass, used this easily accesible activity to evoke a sense of dignity not only eithin themselves, but to other black people as well. These photos were also used to appeal to the northern whites who did not exactly believe in emancipation by doing "before and after" pictures with black children. The following two sections, one on the civil war and the other after the day of emancipation, discuss the lasting impressions that photography had in each of these situations, on both black and white people.

* Jones, Kellie, "To/From Los Angeles with Betye Saar." Extending the Frozen Moment 2006

In this biographical memoir about Betye Saar by Kellie Jones, we learn about the impacts Saar's work had on the Los Angeles art scene, the black art scene, and intersectional feminism. Beginning with a brief description of one of Saar's most popular works, *The Liberation of Aunt Jemima, 1972,* Jones decribes the black arts movement as representational and destructive of negative stereotypes. After this she transitions to the racial scene in the United States and claims that the Watts race riot most likely catapulted the black arts movement to allow the space for artists like Saar to put out their work. She then goes on to describe Saar's evolution of the idea of the black female body in her artwork, almost always referencing to windows in these pieces. The underground Los Angeles art scene ended up being extremely extensive and left marks that are still visible today.

* “The Lenny Interview: Kimberly Drew, Aka @MuseumMammy.” Lenny Letter, November 27, 2015.

In an interview with Doreen St. Felix, Kimberly Drew discusses her background, work, and intentions. She is the online producer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but gained a sizeable digital footprint through her Instagram page and Tumblr blog. She speaks on her rich artistic background and how even with it she still did not see important black art until much later in her life. This in particular fueled her passion for art, curation, and education, which prompted her to begin her Black Contemporary Art Tumblr. She also elaborated on how her work with the MET on their social media pages is really just to educate and promote as much art as she can.

Reading about the different ways black people have vigourously reclaimed spaces that weren't meant for them is inspiring as it is infuriating. Being a black girl who is quickly subject to the "angry black woman" stereotype, I try not to bring "it" up in every situation where I think race is necessary to mention. However reading about all of these different methods that were used to craft the "us versus them" mentality, from the internet that was made for black people to the photos of Drana and Delia, we've always been racialized. Just after doing some introspection over all of the readings thus far, the United States probably wouldn't exist without the extreme racialized ideologies that permeated, and continue to permeate, nearly every aspect of life. After this week's readings I'm truly beginning to understand just how complex race was and is in the United States between black and white people, and it makes me wonder about any other methods of "othering" that were used at some point.

One of Zoya's questions asked why we don't see more black history in history books and I feel like there are two possible answers. The first is that the people that compiling this information are not looking for this history. Considering that the only archives on this topic that are extensive are that of the slave trade, a part of history which is rightfully shame-inducing to most white people, these editors do not seek out any other types of histories and feel that the history of slavery is one that should not be explored out of respect(?)(I'm guessing this, honestly I don't know what self-respecting historian would silence parts of history that are sad just because they are sad but what do I know?). My second guess is shorter, that the people who are editing these texts are being told what to produce by people who fund their work, who might only care about a history that involves those of European descent.


# Questions

* Will Aunt Jemima ever get pulled off the shelves? If the brand did, in what ways would it affect black people?

* If a protest that ended like the Watts riot did were to happen today, what would be the repercussions? Who would respond on social media? How?

* Now that Kendall Jenner has officially been "traumatized" by her adult decision to participate in a project whose details were fully disclosed to her and essentially cemented her position in the limelight for at least another year, what will black media/art do with her? Will we acknowledge her at all?
