# Overview
Envisioning Emancipation: Discusses a topic that we reviewed last week about how photographs and their meanings are not necessarily the facts that surrounded the situation. It challenges the stories and controversies over slavery because the photographs provide a record of these black people. 
To/From Los Angeles: Betye Saar impacted the Black Art community by breaking down stereotypes and taking back ownership of the history for Black people through art. Artists takes the geo-historical events around them to interpret and recreate. This provides a fresh narrative controlled by Black artists who want to express other topics of feminism, empowerment, or modernism rather than primarily white artists during slavery. 
Lenny Interview: An interview with Kimberly Drew who is in charge of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s media manager. Her work with online media helps restructure the “whiteness” that has said to be inherent in the art world. 
Future Lab Africa: Jepchumba developed the “future selfie booth” in a museum in Johannesburg to help people think about what they would tell themselves 100 years in the future. She discusses how “Africa Now” is one step that will help Africa implement technology and take advantage of the technology to think about what can be revolutionized or what can be made different about Africans in the future. 
# Reflection
One thing that was quite appalling to me is the story of Delia and Dana. The implications and purposefulness behind the way they were posed to look directly at the camera, with no shirt on was incredibly demoralizing. The goal of the photographer was to make them look inferior and more like scientific subjects. It is this kind of non-physical “violence” through archival material (photographs, postcards, newspapers, signs, etc.) that has perpetuated the racial divide between white and black people.

This article discusses how new justice Neil Gorsuch will continue interruptions of female justices. The article states that people believed that the female justices such as Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were interrupted because they were the most junior. Now that a male, for the first time in a while, is junior people are speculating that he won’t be interrupted as much as the females. This is interesting to me that such an insignificant statistic can mean so much about our gender divide. 
# Comment
In response to Jack: Is photography always interpreted as factual?
I’m in a photography class right now and photographs are definitely not interpreted as fact. We use photoshop to twist and manipulate photos to enhance certain features or focal points that we want the audience to see. If they were entirely factual, everyone would take away the same information from it. However, photography is up to the “eye of the beholder.”
# Questions
1.	In response to Jepchumba, why are Africans afraid to think about their future?
2.	Kimberly Drew is giving a Black flavor to art, has she seen a rise in Black followers in these social media accounts for the Metropolitan Museum of Art?
3.	“As we found them Virginia Slave children rescued” – Was this a way for slave owners to brag about how good they are to their slaves?
