### Overview
* Mitchell, Michele. “Silences Broken, Silences Kept: Gender and Sexuality in African-American History.”

Mitchell's piece discusses the lack of discussion on certain topics within the revival, repossession, and rewriting of African American history. Her writing focuses on the 'culture of dissemblance' in the African-American women community nationwide after the end of the Civil War. Mitchell advocates for a continuing discussion of the African American experience in all its various forms and facets, specifically gender differences, alongside discussion on other marginal groups such as Asian Americans, Afro-Cubans, and other to begin to fully connect and understand the vast segments of history that have bee left blank by the Eurocentric narrative. She also hopes that such an endeavor would aid in the current day racial and political sphere. 

* Smith, Barbara. "A Press of Our Own Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press." 

Kitchen Table: Women of Colour press is, as the name implies, a press for women of colour this article reiterates this organization's history and founding. Begun in 1980, this press organization worked to provide a platform for the voices of marginalized women of colour who were disenfranchised and had their voices hidden from the narrative of the majority. It allowed for these marginalized communities to have their writings published and their vices heard. The issues of dealing with white feminism are also discussed.  

* Gumbs, Alexis Pauline, "Seek the Roots: An Immersive and Interactive Archive of Black Feminist Practice," 

Audre Lorde's poem except makes up the roots of this piece on roots of the black feminist movement. The reiteration of the act of 'drying words' carry the conversation around how various LGBT organizations around the world are coming together and utilizing their resources to push forward their positive message in the world. It is a form of survival for the information they generate for the world.

* Bailey, Moya. “#transform(ing)DH Writing and Research: An Autoethnography of Digital Humanities and Feminist Ethics” 

Moya focuses on her research of black trans women and their creation of networks through digital media production. In order to do so, this community goes through unheard of emotional and uncompensated labor that Moya hopes to shine a light on. The significance of social media is that it allows marginalized communities to challenge majoritarian norms by creating their own spaces to voice their opinions. She works to build understanding of a digital alchemy she calls health praxis, that is designed to create better representations for those most marginalized in the Western biomedical industrial complex through the implementation of networks of care beyond its boundaries. 

* Ramanathan, Lavanya, “Very Smart Brothas Is the Blackest Thing That Ever Happened to the Internet. Period.” 

Very Smart Brothas is a website owned by Damon Young and D. Marcellus Wright. Young focuses on race, while Wright writes on music and pop culture. Their website has been steadily gaining popularity, with readers drawn to their witty and frank discussion of American reality. The article focuses on their beginnings as partners and their websites, creation, sprinkled with tidbits of Wright and Young's personal life stories.
### Reflection
I found the interplay of meanings behind the word 'queer' in Gumbs' piece was both humorous and insightful.

The Kitchen Table press was in the late 1900's what social media has evolved into today. This piece was so relevant, seeing as I think the 'All Lives Matter' movement today is essentially the 'why don't white women get published by your company' of that time. 

This thread continues in Mitchel's paper, where an excerpt points to the lack of gender issue discussion in Afro-American history, and the similar lack of discussion of race in women's history. 

The Very Smart Brothas article helped introduce me to another segment of minorities speaking out about the inequality in America, which I really appreciate. 
### Expand
I decided to read some of Audre Lorde's poetry after this, and the pieces I stumbled upon were profound. Here is one such example: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/53918
### Comment
To answer Channing's first question from her lab log from last week, I would like to think that I would submit a selfie of me traveling in the world somewhere, to remind myself of the adventures I had in my youth (of course with makeup looking great as well). 
### Questions
1. Do you think the Very Smart Brothas duo has regretted talking about their families in interviews? From a safety standpoint.
2. Would you consider The Tempest to be the modern day form of the Kitchen Table press?
3. Would following through with what Mitchell advocates cause fractures in the African American community?
