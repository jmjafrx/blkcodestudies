# Overview

* Kim Gallon, Black Digital Humanities, "Debates in the Digital Humanities" 2016

In this interactive article, Kim Gallon expresses her concerns and motives for the existence of a black digital humanities category throughout academia. Gallon focuses mainly on the "process of recovery," and how that is the main job of black digital humanities, making its existence and acknowledgement more than necessary. She emphasizes that many histories, stories, and lives have been lost because of the heavy focus on eurocentric lives. One way she supports this is with the statement that "Black studies is nearing its fiftieth birthday," even though black people have existed for much longer than 5 decades, the overarching field has only existed for this time. Gallon commends other methods of black history recovery, however she concludes that without the acknowledgement of black digital humanities, more time and histories will be lost.

* Weheliye, "Engendering Phonographies: Sonic Technologies of Blackness" Small Axe

Throughout this section of a larger narrative, Alexander Weheliye examines *Phonographies,* a piece written by Tavia Nyong'o, and compares the ideologies that were present and also missing to the themes in Weheliye's second book. He spends a large amount of time on the fact that the importance of sound permeates in and out of black cultures around the world, and without technology and modernity also invading black sound, the black experience wouldn't be complete. However one critique that Weheliye points out in Nyong'o's piece was the absence of black women, trans women, and gender non-conforming folks in his analysis. Weheliye then goes on to say that by continuing to exclude these groups of people, the analysis of sound that is being presented in *Phonographies* is incomplete. 

* Haynes, Tonya. “Mapping Caribbean Cyberfeminisms.” Sx Archipelagos, no. 1 (May 1, 2016)

This online article by Tonya Haynes outlines the strides that Caribbean women have made in feminist blogs over the past 16 years. Haynes begins the piece with an incident in which a woman died and the reponse from the government was one that garnered so much negative attention and protests that the movement gained momentum. We are then introduced to a number of blogs and organizations whose following and support stemmed from cyberspace. One of these including a YouTube show called *Air Me Now* that discusses "Caribbean women's voices, Caribbean women's issues, and Caribbean oomnaism." In the following two sections the 36 blogs that Haynes decides to map out are described by at least one of the following nine categories: Personal-is-political, witty, +feminist, feminist-academic, poetry blog, LGBT, culture critic, media crossover, and curator. The following three sections all describe the ways and methods in which these blogs use their platforms. Haynes describes their identities and cultural following, their worries, and their method of sharing their art beyond their main blogs as being all equally important. The last section of the article focuses on the future of these spaces and where these different bloggers all intend to go, on and off line.

* Wangechi Mutu

An extremely creative website where the work, muses, and background on artist and educator Wangechi Mutu presides. Mutu works in New York and Nairobi with nearly all modes of art being showcased all around the world. The artist currently has exhibits in New York, Hong Kong, and soon, Houston. She experiments with art on paper, sculptures and video exhibits, all of which can be previewed on her website. Mutu also started an initiative called Africa's Out! in response to the legislation passed throughout east Africa that was directly discriminatory against those in the LGBTQ+ community.


# Reflection

Throughout reading all of these narratives I was brought to two places. The first one was the conversation on black students and their place in activism, specifically the article by Robin D. G. Kelly. All four sources were, in some fashion, focused on how academia could be and is intertwined with internet use. In the Gallon article, there was the ability to annotate said article and have that annotation be public to everyone who else who read the article, an explicit example, outside of pure content, that allows for an easy flow of conversation between academia and the web. However in Kelly’s article, he repeatedly makes the claim that black students are not as involved as they could be in activism. However, all throughout Tonya Haynes’ article about Caribbean bloggers putting together feminism and sometimes academia, a sizeable portion of the people crafting these online spaces were or still are students. After this series of readings I just find it very difficult to believe that young black people aren’t creating their own versions of activism, and flourishing. 


# Expand

As someone who struggles to find it comfortable to identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community in a black American and Nigerian household, Wangechi Mutu’s creation and work on Africa’s Out! Really struck a chord with me. I figured I would look some more into it and found this [article](http://www.essence.com/2015/06/05/artist-wangechi-mutu-africa-out-campaign-solange) from Essence about Mutu’s campaign. 


# Comment

In response to JB’s first question about the gaps in history concerning queer, lesbian, and gender non-conforming folks and the reaction that feminist scholars have now, I don’t think you’re asking the right questions. We clearly have improved and there is clearly work to do, so how can we dig deeper than this? I think a more appropriate question would be, in what ways do we need to improve when it comes to visibility? Because while Laverne Cox is incredibly important to the fight for black trans women, she is not the only black trans woman. Acknowledging that within the LGBTQ+ community there are hierarchies and then adding in factors like colorism and then where exactly within the diaspora do you identify all changes the “acceptability” of these women and non-conforming folks. So in order to combat this multi-leveled problem, we have to start by asking questions that aren’t surface level.


# Questions

* What else could come out of the “official” creation of a black digital humanities program other than recovery of documents? Kim Gallon mentions that whole careers are at risk when the black DH isn’t acknowledged, so what else could be lost?

* What was Kenya/Ethiopia/other east African countries reactions to the creation of Africa’s Out!? Who made the response? Was there ever a reaction at all?

* Sound is more than just a form of expression in both Alexander Weheliye’s and Tavia Nyong’o’s books. What other creative outlets have transcended just being known as a form of expression?
