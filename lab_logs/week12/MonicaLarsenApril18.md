## Overview
### Mitchell, Michele. “Silences Broken, Silences Kept: Gender and Sexuality in African-American History.”
In this article, Mitchell highlights the struggles that face black women and the black LGBTQ community. She explains how gender and sexuality affect power dynamics within the Black community and focuses on the levels of oppression that exist within groups of oppressed people and how these overlaps affect the individuals who experience it. She argues that if "African Americans are now analysing intra-racial class tensions" there is no reason why intra-racial gender issues should not also be analysed in a similar way.  
### Smith, Barbara. "A Press of Our Own Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press."
Smith talks about a group of women started a group to bring light to the literary work of women of color. This devoted group of women noticed and acted upon the fact that women of color and especially women of color in the LGBT community do not have a voice within the literary community. They published works by women who are overlooked because of their skin color and sexual orientation so that this space can put these marginalized groups of women at the forefront.
### Gumbs, Alexis Pauline, "Seek the Roots: An Immersive and Interactive Archive of Black Feminist Practice,"
Gumbs explains the importance of putting black feminist writers in the spot light. She especially gives queer black women the credit that's due and would be due if they weren't queer or black or a woman or any intersection of the three. She describes the Smith sisters and their work in bringing the struggles of Black lesbian artists and writers to the forefront. They explain how as black women, lesbians, and feminists there will never be a guarantee that their works and their lives would be as respected as if they weren't any of these things.
### Bailey, Moya. “#transform(ing)DH Writing and Research: An Autoethnography of Digital Humanities and Feminist Ethics”
Bailey researched the work of Black trans women and how their efforts in digital media go overlooked. Black trans women are one of the most vulnerable groups of people in the United States and she gives statistics on the deaths of Black trans women to support her claim that Black trans women are uniquely targeted because of the intersection between their gender, race, and trans status. She highlights the digital media work that Black trans women do that get little to no attention.
### Ramanathan, Lavanya, “Very Smart Brothas Is the Blackest Thing That Ever Happened to the Internet. Period.”
Very Smart Brothas is a website created for Black thought on current events and is used as a "stream-of-consciousness" of the black point of view. Ramanathan talks about interactions with Young, one of the editors in chief, and his thoughts on current events and the way the media uses racism as a hot topic without the point of view of Black individuals, which his website provides.
## Reflection
These articles highlight marginalized groups within the Black community and the importance of intersectionality within feminism. The overlaps contribute to the oppression felt by these groups of people because there is not just the oppression of being Black, but also of being a woman or being queer or being trans.
## Expand
http://verysmartbrothas.com/steve-stephens-murderer/ this article is relevant because people have been blaming black women for the murder that Steve Stephens has committed
## Comment
In response to Zoya, I don't think that they have regretted talking about their families in interviews because I think that they want to be able to live normally...but I'm sure that it is a worry that they have.
## Question
* Do you think that now that more Black women are earning college degrees than any other demographic the work of Black women will be showcased fairly?
* How do you think that queerness in the Black community can be made more acceptable?
* If Very Smart Brothas was put in the spotlight on big news networks, do you think more white people would start going on the site?
