#### Overview

Kim Gallon, Black Digital Humanities, "Debates in the Digital Humanities" 2016

- Gallon seeks to explore how digital humanities and Black Studies intersect, to “further expose humanity as a racialized social construction.” She does not focus on who or what can be considered “black”, because it diverts attention from the complexity of her intended topic. Instead, Gallon delves deeper, addressing the “technology of recovery” in black digital humanities scholarship: a “constructed space”, rather than a “thing”. Unfortunately, race is an issue even within this constructed space. Hashtags and other forms of discourse against the academic hegemony have recently surfaced, and will hopefully allow more light to be show on Black studies work. 
- Black studies, Gallon states, must incorporate blackness as more than a phenotypic label, but as a “conglomerate of social political relations”. The “technology of recovery” is a way to reveal the ways these socio-political aspects are intertwined with, not just a contributor to, digital humanities. Anyone can use these recovery tactics, from historians, to everyday black people on Twitter, and even independent scholars with various digital tools (text mining or topic modeling). Other means of exploring the social, political and cultural aspects of Black studies are welcome, Gallon notes, but there is a great need for the deeper exploration and understanding of the topic, and consequently humanity. 

Weheliye, Alexander G. "Engendering Phonographies: Sonic Technologies of Blackness" Small Axe

- Alexander G. Weheliye is the author of Phonographies and Habeas Viscus: Racializing Assemblages, Biopolitics, and Black Feminist Theories of the Human. However, he notes that his mindset has changed since the publishing of Phonographies in 2011. While Phonographies effectively “[magnifies] some of the ways blackness--and thus modernity--is constituted by sound and technology”, Habeas Viscus focuses on the visual: a “parallel [argument] about the significance of race and blackness for the study of modernity” (Weheliye 184, 43). Specifically, Habeas Viscus mandates the inclusion of black feminists and black studies perspectives when studying modern, and especially Western humanity (Weheliye 44). 

- While critiquing his previous works, Weheliye includes other themes including the importance of “claiming, though not owning” Western modernity and the understanding that black culture has contributed to modernity as a part of the West, rather than an external component (Weheliye 181). He employs this argument when discussion music, referencing Nyong’o, who speaks to the incorrect notion that Africa possesses all music that is “disordered”, and therefore Western nations possess order, in spite of the fact that African music is the origin of (black) music (Nyong'o 186). 

- Weheliye’s greatest critique of Phonographies was its poor conceptual exploration of black women and black feminism, and the way racial discourse obscures discussions of gender and sex. He focuses more on these topics in Habeas Viscus.

Haynes, Tonya. “Mapping Caribbean Cyberfeminisms.” Sx Archipelagos, no. 1 (May 1, 2016).

- In “Mapping Caribbean Cyberfeminisms”, Tonya Haynes focuses on Caribbean cyberfeminism, which challenges dominant hegemonic ideas of technology and feminism. These cyberfeminisms (usually as blogs) are incredibly diverse and cohesive, often inciting significant “on-the-ground” action in many communities. There are limitations however. Though word spreads quickly with reposting, liking, and sharing, some digital spaces are inaccessible to others because of certain language barriers.  Haynes, however, was not deterred. She selected 36 active Caribbean feminist blogs to analyze and document, focusing exclusively on text based blogs that had been updated no earlier than July 2015.

- Haynes used various phrases to categorize each blog, including “Personal-is-political”, “culture critic”, “+Feminism”, “Media crossover”, “feminist-academic” and “Curator”. The article contains a table of each blog, it’s blogger, affiliated country, and categorization. Many bloggers, male and female, identified themselves as feminists in conjunction with their identity, and expressed their beliefs in a space for Caribbean Cyberfeminisms. Within their own spaces, bloggers employ the stories of others, personal anecdotes, and analysis of tensions within their communities regarding Caribbean feminist concerns, including LGBT rights, sexualization, genderization, sexual violence, heteronormativity and more.

- There are Caribbean feminists working outside of online blogs and social media platforms, with various media campaigns and corporate platforms, which unfortunately, misconstrue their intended messages. In the future however, the increased access to various platforms and to different strategic platforms will aid in the spread of Cyberfeminist work. 

Wangechi Mutu: http://wangechimutu.com/

- Wangechi Mutu is a (very) interactive website of the many works by Wangechi Mutu herself. Based in New York and Nairobi, Kenya, Mutu creates art work “On Paper”, “In Space” and “In Motion”, which have been displayed in all over the world. Her installation, from the mid-90s to 2017, are complex and colorful, often as beautiful as they are haunting. The subjects of her more recent two dimensional works are primarily silhouettes of black men, women and children created with a collage of various textures and patterns. Some pieces are simple and eerie, such as the image of a figure biting and attempting to swallow their own hand to feed themself (whether the individual is male or female is not specified), while others appear more provocative. Regardless, the black body, culture, and/or conscience is the subject all of her works. 

#### Reflection

- I am curious about the emotional response Mutu wanted her audience to have upon seeing her work, especially some of her more abstract pieces in the 1990s and early 2000s. Is she purposely exaggerating features of black men, women and children like the eyes and lips? Whose eyes are we looking through? However, I do like how she uses the female body as a focus in her work. Furthermore, I like how she is not afraid of the female body. One of my favorite images in her “On Paper” set from the early 2000s is of a woman, nude from the waist up, reclining back on a bed of flowers with a gun in her left hand. A dog (or wolf) licks her left leg, and she looks at it (or into the distance) unafraid. In this image, it seems like she is presenting a black woman as a entity with power, able to wield power and tame beasts. 

#### Expand
- In another one of my classes we just finished reading James Baldwin’s “Many Thousands Gone”, a short essay from Notes of a Native Son. This essay discusses another dimension of the black American experience in the 1950s, but is hauntingly reflective of today the state of America today. In discussions of the black experience and black identity, the reason why black people are angry is often forgotten. This “why” goes further than police brutality and racist remarks, but the internalized hatred of the black man himself. Baldwin is unafraid to question the black psyche in his analysis of “The American Negro”. One of my favorite parts is below. (If the image doesn't show, it is pages 37 to 38 [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=HDnxq1cyEq4C&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=let+us+refrain+from+inquiring+at+the+moment+whether+or+not+he+actually+exists+for+we+believe+that+he+exists+baldwin&source=bl&ots=zLpgDhtyNJ&sig=kpk90H4SWEBmvgq-OCZoKru0lNM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiP8J7JsLPTAhXEbSYKHRVzCmoQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&q=let%20us%20refrain%20from%20inquiring%20at%20the%20moment%20whether%20or%20not%20he%20actually%20exists%20for%20we%20believe%20that%20he%20exists%20baldwin&f=false).)

#### Comment

- In response to Channing’s question from Lab Log 14, I think African hair braiding is among the most direct connections black people in American (and all over the world) have with the past. Ironically, unlike many technologies, this one has not changed. The girl who got her hair braided by her mother, father, sister, brother, or whoever in the early 1900s probably may have felt the same amount of intimacy (and pain) as the girl getting her hair braided down the road. I think it is primarily political because of its association with black people, especially in the United States, but it can be a form of resistance. An example is Natural Hair Movement that has sprung up in the past few years. It is a way to promote healthy hair but also to love one’s self and to stop using of white phenotypic standards as a normative standard for beauty (Winx Club). 

#### Question

- What message(s) do you think Wangechi Mutu wanted to give through her work? How did you interpret the art? Beautiful? Grotesque? Confusing?
- Is the black American community still reluctant to look within itself and to self-criticize? What does a movement that embraces the “stereotypical American Negro” look like compared to a movement that understands even deeper meanings of black identity and hatred which Baldwin speaks to? 
- Alexander G. Weheliye talks about the black community “claiming, though not owning” Western modernity. How can we incorporate the black contributions to modernity within historical discussions as a reason, not an isolated byproduct, of modernization?
