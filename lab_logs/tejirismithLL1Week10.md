* Handler, Jerome S., and Annis Steiner. "Identifying Pictorial Images of Atlantic Slavery: Three Case Studies." Slavery & Abolition 27, no. 1 (2006): 51–71.

This article opens with an introduction that sheds light on the pictorial inaccuracy that runs rampant throughout the subject of the Atlantic Slave Trade. Handler and Steiner discuss the compoundment of these errors when authors use these incorrect sources, only magnifying the problem. The first picture that is consistently cited improperly is a copy of an engraving of slaves in devices called "coffles" found in a journal published in 1865. The authors explain that part of the confusion about a primary source lies in the fact that scholars are having a difficult time trying to find the actual artist. The next picture this article discusses is one that depicts a slave being thrown off a ship into the ocean. Just as with the last photo, this picture has cited incorrectly and there is no information about artist. In the final picture, the authors discuss a drawing by a French man of a Brazilian slave, and how while there is ample information on the artist, in some instances there are cases where the drawing is claimed to have an unknown artist. The article concludes on the fact that without historical context, images are unable to speak for themselves.

This book excerpt begins with a recount of Englishman, Richard Ligan's first encounter with a black woman. In his many manuscripts they are first described as beautiful and awesome in size. As Jennifer Morgan points out however, the rhetoric very quickly changes from appreciation of beauty to ogling the "other." Narratives about African American and Native women quickly became fetishized in 1600s. Sexualizing black and indigenous women in ways that were positive as well as negative entered the conversation immediately following this. For example, in the journals of Amerigo Vespucci there is a focus on the fact that these womens' breasts could drag on the ground, but their bodies also held well after childbirth. The rest of the book then goes on to give the many examples of the "us and them" ideology that ran rampant throughout European narratives, establishing the racial hiearchy that conintues today.

* “Interview: Kara Walker Decodes Her New World Sphinx at Domino Sugar Factory.” Complex. Accessed January 28, 2017.

In this transcribed interview, Kara Walker discusses the ins and outs of her sculture, The Subtelty. The interviewers begins with the question why: why this idea, why this space, why sugar and molasses, why make it public, etc, etc. Walker answers with a straight-forwardness that leaves no room for speculation but some room for question development, making the questions transition effortlessly. After the why topic, the interviewer then moves to the history behind the piece and what work Walker had to do in that realm. Walker, again, answers with intelligence and grace as she explains that every decision that was made about this art piece was meticulous and well-crafted, and without a thorough background she could not have put out such a wonder. 


# Reflection

I know I shouldn't be surprised that fetishization and simultaneous degradation of black women was established so early but I really couldn't help myself. Reading all the encounters and journal entries about those black and indigenous women very quickly took me back to tweets I've seen, comments made to me, and the constant portrayls of black women in the media. So seeing it start so early was shocking to say the least. Thinking of this topic in relation to whether documentation of violent acts is also violent makes me uncomfortable. Just because it's a very delicate and multi-faceted issue to face, the perpetuation of violence that is. In this case, I do not believe that talking about the creation of racial gendered hierachies perpetuates the same violence because the same violence is already being continued in a very obvious way at a very high level. However when discussing the creation of slave ship databases the question is not just is it violent or not, because truthfully at a face level it is. There is nothing different from what current scholars are doing from what slave ship captains and scribes are doing, however their reasonings make all the difference in my opinion. Scholars and historians very purpose for taking on this project, I feel at least, is to try and remember every single human that was affected by the claws of slavery, immortalizing the violent does not necessarily mean one is okay with the violence.

# Comment

In response to Channing's second question from last week, I feel that it doesn't really matter how many black people have visited the Goree house if even only one person feels some kind of historical connection or familial background. I imagine it would be difficult to live with yourself knowing that there's a history that is connected to you in some way but you just haven't reached it yet. 


# Questions

* When identifying information that has been used incorrectly, how do scholars address that? If they see wrong citations is there anything that can be done?

* Why is it that pictures have repeated mis-citations that are all slightly similar? Are ideas on slaves already so biased and preconceived that the need to question validity no longer holds? Would this/is this a problem with other kinds of white/European histories?

* In the dual perception of black women and other women of color what traits are associated with the two sides in modern times? (i.e. good - light-skinned women, bad - dark-skinned women)
